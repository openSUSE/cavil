{"license":"GFDL-1.3","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"Version 1.3, 3 November 2008\n\nCopyright @copyright{} 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008\n@uref{http:\/\/www.fsf.org\/,Free Software Foundation@comma{} Inc.}\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n@unnumberedsubsec  0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document ``free'' in the sense of freedom:\nto assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with\nor without modifying it, either commercially or\nnoncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and\npublisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered\nresponsible for modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that\nderivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same\nsense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free program\nshould come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software\ndoes. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used\nfor any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is\npublished as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for\nworks whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n@unnumberedsubsec  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work\nunder the conditions stated herein. The ``Document'', below,\nrefers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,\nand is addressed as ``you''. You accept the license if you copy,\nmodify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under\ncopyright law.\n\nA ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing\nthe Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\n\nA ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter\nsection of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of\nthe publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection\nwith the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\nphilosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\nThe ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose\ntitles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License. If a section\ndoes not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to\nbe designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant\nSections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then\nthere are none.\n\nThe ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are\nlisted, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says\nthat the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable\ncopy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for\nautomatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text\nformatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose\nmarkup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage\nsubsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is\nnot Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is\nnot ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII\nwithout markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML\nusing a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,\nPostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent\nimage formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary\nformats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,\nSGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally\navailable, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by\nsome word processors for output purposes only.\n\nThe ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page\nitself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the\nmaterial this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page''\nmeans the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's\ntitle, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nThe ``publisher'' means any person or entity that distributes\ncopies of the Document to the public.\n\nA section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document\nwhose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses\nfollowing text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands\nfor a specific section name mentioned below, such as\n``Acknowledgements'', ``Dedications'',\n``Endorsements'', or ``History''.) To ``Preserve\nthe Title'' of such a section when you modify the Document means that\nit remains a section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this\ndefinition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,\nbut only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that\nthese Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the\nmeaning of this License.\n@unnumberedsubsec  2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright\nnotices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the\nDocument are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical\nmeasures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the\ncopies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in\nexchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you\nmust also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you\nmay publicly display copies.\n@unnumberedsubsec  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\nthe copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the\nback cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the\npublisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title\nwith all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add\nother material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to\nthe covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy\nthese conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,\nyou should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the\nactual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more\nthan 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy\nalong with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\ncomputer-network location from which the general network-using public has\naccess to download using public-standard network protocols a complete\nTransparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the\nlatter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent\ncopy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\nyear after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or\nthrough your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n@unnumberedsubsec  4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\nconditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the\nModified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version\nfilling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and\nmodification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In\naddition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n@enumerate\n\n@item\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\nfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which\nshould, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the\nDocument). You may use the same title as a previous version if the\noriginal publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n@item\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\nresponsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\nVersion, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\nDocument (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\nunless they release you from this requirement","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"6b8da45b-fdb6-4541-9014-423a776e2f2f"}
