Previous versions of FFTW were\ndistributed without fee for noncommercial use, but were not\ntechnically ``free.''\n\nNon-free licenses for FFTW are also available that permit different\nterms of use than the GPL.\n\n\\question 10apr:nonfree  What is this about non-free licenses?\n\nThe non-free licenses are for companies that wish to use FFTW in their\nproducts but are unwilling to release their software under the GPL\n(which would require them to release source code and allow free\nredistribution).  Such users can purchase an unlimited-use license\nfrom MIT.  Contact us for more details.\n\nWe could instead have released FFTW under the LGPL, or even disallowed\nnon-Free usage.  Suffice it to say, however, that MIT owns the\ncopyright to FFTW and they only let us GPL it because we convinced\nthem that it would neither affect their licensing revenue nor irritate\nexisting licensees","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"6e70e862-5465-411b-b7ff-9dceef767ae3"}
