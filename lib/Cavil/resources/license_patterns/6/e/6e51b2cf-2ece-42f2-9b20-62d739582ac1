{"license":"GFDL-1.3","opinion":0,"packname":"gdb","patent":0,"pattern":"Free Software Needs Free Documentation\n======================================\n\nThe biggest deficiency in the free software community today is not in\nthe software--it is the lack of good free documentation that we can\ninclude with the free software.  Many of our most important programs do\nnot come with free reference manuals and free introductory texts.\nDocumentation is an essential part of any software package; when an\nimportant free software package does not come with a free manual and a\nfree tutorial, that is a major gap.  We have many such gaps today.\n\n   Consider Perl, for instance.  The tutorial manuals that people\nnormally use are non-free.  How did this come about?  Because the\nauthors of those manuals published them with restrictive terms--no\ncopying, no modification, source files not available--which exclude\nthem from the free software world.\n\n   That wasn't the first time this sort of thing happened, and it was\nfar from the last.  Many times we have heard a GNU user eagerly\ndescribe a manual that he is writing, his intended contribution to the\ncommunity, only to learn that he had ruined everything by signing a\npublication contract to make it non-free.\n\n   Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not\nprice.  The problem with the non-free manual is not that publishers\ncharge a price for printed copies--that in itself is fine.  (The Free\nSoftware Foundation sells printed copies of manuals, too.)  The problem\nis the restrictions on the use of the manual.  Free manuals are\navailable in source code form, and give you permission to copy and\nmodify.  Non-free manuals do not allow this.\n\n   The criteria of freedom for a free manual are roughly the same as for\nfree software.  Redistribution (including the normal kinds of\ncommercial redistribution) must be permitted, so that the manual can\naccompany every copy of the program, both on-line and on paper.\n\n   Permission for modification of the technical content is crucial too.\nWhen people modify the software, adding or changing features, if they\nare conscientious they will change the manual too--so they can provide\naccurate and clear documentation for the modified program.  A manual\nthat leaves you no choice but to write a new manual to document a\nchanged version of the program is not really available to our community.\n\n   Some kinds of limits on the way modification is handled are\nacceptable.  For example, requirements to preserve the original\nauthor's copyright notice, the distribution terms, or the list of\nauthors, are ok.  It is also no problem to require modified versions to\ninclude notice that they were modified.  Even entire sections that may\nnot be deleted or changed are acceptable, as long as they deal with\nnontechnical topics (like this one).  These kinds of restrictions are\nacceptable because they don't obstruct the community's normal use of\nthe manual.\n\n   However, it must be possible to modify all the _technical_ content\nof the manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual media,\nthrough all the usual channels.  Otherwise, the restrictions obstruct\nthe use of the manual, it is not free, and we need another manual to\nreplace it.\n\n   Please spread the word about this issue.  Our community continues to\nlose manuals to proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that\nfree software needs free reference manuals and free tutorials, perhaps\nthe next person who wants to contribute by writing documentation will\nrealize, before it is too late, that only free manuals contribute to\nthe free software community.\n\n   If you are writing documentation, please insist on publishing it\nunder the GNU Free Documentation License or another free documentation\nlicense.  Remember that this decision requires your approval--you don't\nhave to let the publisher decide.  Some commercial publishers will use\na free license if you insist, but they will not propose the option; it\nis up to you to raise the issue and say firmly that this is what you\nwant.  If the publisher you are dealing with refuses, please try other\npublishers.  If you're not sure whether a proposed license is free,\nwrite to <licensing@gnu.org>.\n\n   You can encourage commercial publishers to sell more free, copylefted\nmanuals and tutorials by buying them, and particularly by buying copies\nfrom the publishers that paid for their writing or for major\nimprovements.  Meanwhile, try to avoid buying non-free documentation at\nall.  Check the distribution terms of a manual before you buy it, and\ninsist that whoever seeks your business must respect your freedom.\nCheck the history of the book, and try to reward the publishers that\nhave paid or pay the authors to work on it.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation maintains a list of free documentation\npublished by other publishers, at\n`http:\/\/www.fsf.org\/doc\/other-free-books.html","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"6e51b2cf-2ece-42f2-9b20-62d739582ac1"}
