ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\r\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\"Contribution\" means:\r\n\r\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\r\ndocumentation distributed under this Agreement, and\r\n\r\nb) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\r\n\r\ni) changes to the Program, and\r\n\r\nii) additions to the Program;\r\n\r\nwhere such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from and\r\nare distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\r\n'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\r\nContributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\r\nbehalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\r\n(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with\r\nthe Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\r\nderivative works of the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\r\nwhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\r\nalone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\r\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\r\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\r\nlicense to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\r\npublicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\r\nContributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\r\nobject code form.\r\n\r\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\r\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\r\nlicense under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\r\nimport and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if\r\nany, in source code and object code form.  This patent license shall\r\napply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\r\nthe time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\r\nof the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\r\nLicensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\r\ncombinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\r\nlicensed hereunder.\r\n\r\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\r\nlicenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\r\nprovided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\r\npatent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\r\nContributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\r\nany other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\r\nor otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\r\ngranted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility\r\nto secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\r\nexample, if a third party patent license is required to allow\r\nRecipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\r\nto acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\n\r\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\r\ncopyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\r\nlicense set forth in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\r\nunder its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\n\r\nb) its license agreement:\r\n\r\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\r\nand conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\r\nconditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\r\nconditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\n\r\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\r\nfor damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\r\nconsequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\n\r\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\r\noffered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\n\r\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\r\nContributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\r\nmanner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\n\r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\n\r\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\n\r\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\r\nwithin the Program.\r\n\r\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\r\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\r\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\r\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\r\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\r\nof the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\r\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\r\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\r\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\r\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend\r\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\r\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\r\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\r\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\r\nor omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\r\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.  The\r\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\r\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\r\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\r\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\r\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\r\nthe Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\r\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\r\nclaim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\r\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\r\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\r\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\r\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\r\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\r\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\r\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\r\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\r\nmust pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\r\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\r\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\r\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\r\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\r\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\r\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\r\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to\r\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\r\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\r\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\r\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\r\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\r\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\r\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\r\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\r\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\r\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\r\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\r\nthe Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other\r\nsoftware or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such\r\nRecipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of\r\nthe date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\r\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\r\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\r\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\r\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\r\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably\r\npracticable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and\r\nany licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall\r\ncontinue and survive.\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\r\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\r\nmay only be modified in the following manner.

Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\r\ndistinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)\r\nmay always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\r\nunder which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\r\nAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the\r\nProgram (including its Contributions) under the new version.
