Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute\r\nverbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n0. PREAMBLE\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\r\nfunctional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure\r\neveryone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\r\nmodifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this\r\nLicense preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for\r\ntheir work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made\r\nby others.\r\n\r\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of\r\nthe document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the\r\nGNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\r\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free program\r\nshould come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software\r\ndoes. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used\r\nfor any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is\r\npublished as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for\r\nworks whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n\r\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\r\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\r\ndistributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a\r\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work\r\nunder the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any\r\nsuch manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\r\naddressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or\r\ndistribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\r\n\r\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document\r\nor a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or\r\ntranslated into another language.\r\n\r\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the\r\nDocument that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or\r\nauthors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related\r\nmatters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall\r\nsubject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a\r\nSecondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could\r\nbe a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related\r\nmatters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political\r\nposition regarding them.\r\n\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are\r\ndesignated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\r\nthat the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\r\nthe above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated\r\nas Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the\r\nDocument does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as\r\nFront-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the\r\nDocument is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most\r\n5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\r\n\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\r\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the general\r\npublic, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with\r\ngeneric text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint\r\nprograms or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that\r\nis suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a\r\nvariety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an\r\notherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has\r\nbeen arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is\r\nnot Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any\r\nsubstantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called\r\n\"Opaque\".\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII\r\nwithout markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using\r\na publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript\r\nor PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image\r\nformats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary\r\nformats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,\r\nSGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally\r\navailable, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by\r\nsome word processors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus\r\nsuch following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this\r\nLicense requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do\r\nnot have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most\r\nprominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the\r\nbody of the text.\r\n\r\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the\r\nDocument to the public.\r\n\r\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title\r\neither is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that\r\ntranslates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section\r\nname mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\r\n\"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section\r\nwhen you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\"\r\naccording to this definition.\r\n\r\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\r\nstates that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty\r\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but\r\nonly as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these\r\nWarranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially\r\nor noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and\r\nthe license notice saying this License applies to the Document are\r\nreproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever\r\nto those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or\r\ncontrol the reading or further copying of the copies you make or\r\ndistribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If\r\nyou distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the\r\nconditions in section 3.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you\r\nmay publicly display copies.\r\n\r\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n\r\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\r\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\r\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies\r\nin covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:\r\nFront-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back\r\ncover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the\r\npublisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with\r\nall words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other\r\nmaterial on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the\r\ncovers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy\r\nthese conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,\r\nyou should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the\r\nactual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more\r\nthan 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\r\nwith each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\r\ncomputer-network location from which the general network-using public has\r\naccess to download using public-standard network protocols a complete\r\nTransparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the\r\nlatter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\r\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent\r\ncopy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\r\nyear after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through\r\nyour agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\r\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\r\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n\r\n4. MODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\r\nconditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the\r\nModified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version\r\nfilling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and\r\nmodification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In\r\naddition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\r\n       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\r\n       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\r\n       of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version\r\n       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\n    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\r\n       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\r\n       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\r\n       Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\r\n       unless they release you from this requirement.\r\n    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified\r\n       Version, as the publisher.\r\n    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\n    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent\r\n       to the other copyright notices.\r\n    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\r\n       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\r\n       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\n    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\r\n       and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\r\n    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\n    I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add\r\n       to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\r\n       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If\r\n       there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\r\n       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\r\n       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\r\n       Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\n    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\r\n       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\r\n       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it\r\n       was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may\r\n       omit a network location for a work that was published at least four\r\n       years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of\r\n       the version it refers to gives permission.\r\n    K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\r\n       Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\r\n       the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\r\n       and\/or dedications given therein.\r\n    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in\r\n       their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent\r\n       are not considered part of the section titles.\r\n    M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not\r\n       be included in the Modified Version.\r\n    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or\r\n       to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\r\n    O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices\r\nthat qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the\r\nDocument, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as\r\ninvariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections\r\nin the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct\r\nfrom any other section titles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing\r\nbut endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example,\r\nstatements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an\r\norganization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\r\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of\r\nCover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text\r\nand one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made\r\nby) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the\r\nsame cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same\r\nentity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may\r\nreplace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher\r\nthat added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\r\npermission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply\r\nendorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\r\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,\r\nprovided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections\r\nof all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as\r\nInvariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that\r\nyou preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\r\nidentical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there\r\nare multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,\r\nmake the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in\r\nparentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section\r\nif known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section\r\ntitles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\r\ncombined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the\r\nvarious original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\";\r\nlikewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections\r\nEntitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled\r\n\"Endorsements\".\r\n\r\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\r\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\r\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the\r\ncollection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\r\ncopying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it\r\nindividually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License\r\ninto the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects\r\nregarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n\r\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\r\nindependent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\r\ndistribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting\r\nfrom the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the\r\ncompilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the\r\nDocument is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the\r\nother works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of\r\nthe Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of\r\nthe Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire\r\naggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket\r\nthe Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers\r\nif the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on\r\nprinted covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\r\n\r\n8. TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\r\ntranslations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\r\nInvariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\r\ncopyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all\r\nInvariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant\r\nSections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the\r\nlicense notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided\r\nthat you also include the original English version of this License and the\r\noriginal versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a\r\ndisagreement between the translation and the original version of this\r\nLicense or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\r\n\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\r\nor \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)\r\nwill typically require changing the actual title.\r\n\r\n9. TERMINATION\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\r\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\r\nmodify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically\r\nterminate your rights under this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from\r\na particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and\r\nuntil the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license,\r\nand (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\r\npermanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some\r\nreasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\r\nviolation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and\r\nyou cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this\r\nLicense. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not\r\ngive you any rights to use it.\r\n\r\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\r\nFree Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be\r\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns. See https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If\r\nthe Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License\r\n\"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the\r\nterms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later\r\nversion that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software\r\nFoundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this\r\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the\r\nFree Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide\r\nwhich future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public\r\nstatement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose\r\nthat version for the Document.\r\n\r\n11. RELICENSING\r\n\r\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World\r\nWide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides\r\nprominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that\r\nanybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor\r\nCollaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of\r\ncopyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\r\n\r\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license\r\npublished by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation\r\nwith a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as\r\nfuture copyleft versions of that license published by that same\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in\r\npart, as part of another Document.\r\n\r\nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License,\r\nand if all works that were first published under this License somewhere\r\nother than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into\r\nthe MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus\r\nincorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\r\n\r\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site\r\nunder CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided\r\nthe MMC is eligible for relicensing.\r\n\r\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\r\n\r\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the\r\nLicense in the document and put the following copyright and license notices\r\njust after the title page:\r\n\r\n    Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\r\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\r\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\r\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\r\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\r\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\r\n    Free Documentation License\".\r\n\r\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\r\nreplace the \"with … Texts.\" line with this:\r\n\r\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\r\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\r\n\r\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\r\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend\r\nreleasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software\r\nlicense, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in\r\nfree software","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"6f3762b3-441b-477d-9d77-7f694237a648"}
