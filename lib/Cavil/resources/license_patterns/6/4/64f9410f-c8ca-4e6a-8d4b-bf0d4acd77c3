I maintain the dumb package for Fedora.\n\nCurrently we are doing a licensing audit of all our packages (what a pain) \nbecause of the coming of GPL version 3.\n\nDuring this audit the DUMB license has been held in the light too, and it has \nbeen deemed a non free license by the lawyers :(\n\nThe problem are the clauses 4 and 5, the lawyers see this as non free \"as it \nimposes absurd restrictions of use on the users of the software\". I noticed in \nthe Debina package that you've given Debian permission to distribute dumb with \nthe 4th and 5th clause removed from the license (and thus the 6th too as that \nthen no longer is necessary). If you could give us permission to do the same \nthat would be great.\n\nA mail saying you will allow this is enough\n\nMany Thanks & Regards,\n\nHans\n\n---\n\nReturn-Path: <entheh@users.sf.net>\nReceived: from koko.hhs.nl ([145.52.2.16] verified)\n  by hhs.nl (CommuniGate Pro SMTP 4.3.6)\n  with ESMTP id 72785570 for j.w.r.degoede@hhs.nl; Mon, 06 Aug 2007 20:09:05 +0200\nReceived: from exim by koko.hhs.nl with spam-scanned (Exim 4.62)\n\t(envelope-from <entheh@users.sf.net>)\n\tid 1II70o-000124-RY\n\tfor j.w.r.degoede@hhs.nl; Mon, 06 Aug 2007 20:09:05 +0200\nX-Spam-Checker-Version: SpamAssassin 3.1.8 (2007-02-13) on koko.hhs.nl\nX-Spam-Level: \nX-Spam-Status: No, score=0.0 required=5.0 tests=BAYES_50 autolearn=ham\n\tversion=3.1.8\nReceived: from exim (helo=koko)\n\tby koko.hhs.nl with local-smtp (Exim 4.62)\n\t(envelope-from <entheh@users.sf.net>)\n\tid 1II70n-00011u-TJ\n\tfor j.w.r.degoede@hhs.nl; Mon, 06 Aug 2007 20:09:01 +0200\nReceived: from [212.74.100.53] (port=27938 helo=mk-filter-2-a-4.mail.uk.tiscali.com)\n\tby koko.hhs.nl with esmtp (Exim 4.62)\n\t(envelope-from <entheh@users.sf.net>)\n\tid 1II70n-00011a-At\n\tfor j.w.r.degoede@hhs.nl; Mon, 06 Aug 2007 20:09:01 +0200\nX-Trace: 599769008-mk-filter-2.mail.uk.tiscali.com-B2C-$THROTTLED-DYNAMIC-CUSTOMER-DYNAMIC-IP\nX-SBRS: None\nX-RemoteIP: 88.106.233.110\nX-IronPort-Anti-Spam-Filtered: true\nX-IronPort-Anti-Spam-Result: AihcAJoAt0ZYaulu\/2dsb2JhbACBOGk\nReceived: from 88-106-233-110.dynamic.dsl.as9105.com ([88.106.233.110])\n  by smtp.business.co.uk with ESMTP; 06 Aug 2007 19:09:00 +0100\nFrom: Ben Davis <entheh@users.sf.net>\nTo: Hans de Goede <j.w.r.degoede@hhs.nl>\nSubject: Re: DUMB license\nDate: Mon, 6 Aug 2007 19:09:20 +0100\nUser-Agent: KMail\/1.9.6\nReferences: <46B75BC0.20002@hhs.nl>\nIn-Reply-To: <46B75BC0.20002@hhs.nl>\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text\/plain;\n  charset=\"utf-8\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Disposition: inline\nMessage-Id: <200708061909.21731.entheh@users.sf.net>\nX-Anti-Virus: Kaspersky Anti-Virus for MailServers 5.5.2\/RELEASE, bases: 06082007 #352893, status: clean\n\nHi :)\n\nTechnically, I renounced Clause 4 for Debian, back when DUMB v0.9.2 was the \nlatest version and Clauses 5 and 6 didn't exist. I had hoped 6 would solve \nthe problem. I never explicitly gave permission for them to remove the jokes \nfrom the licence.\n\nI had also hoped that Clause 5 wouldn't be an issue because it has the get-out \nclause \"if deemed appropriate\", and possibly that Clause 4 is ill-defined \nbecause \"Program\" is never defined anywhere :D but oh well.\n\nYou have my permission to add a note (I suggest above Clause 4) that Clauses 4 \nand 5 (and possibly 6) do not apply to users\/maintainers\/whoever (whichever \nword or words fit best for you) of Fedora, but I'd appreciate it if, unlike \nDebian, you kept the text of the clauses in there for their humour value.\n\nIs this satisfactory","risk":5,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"64f9410f-c8ca-4e6a-8d4b-bf0d4acd77c3"}
