If you make a million\ndollars with it, it would be nice if you would share.  If you make\ncompositions with it, put us in the program notes.\n\nSome of the concepts are covered by various patents, some known to us\nand likely others that are unknown.  Many of the ones known to us are\nadministered by the Stanford Office of Technology and Licensing.  The\ngood news is that large hunks of the techniques used here are public\ndomain.  To avoid subtle legal issues, we will not state what's freely\nuseable here, but we will try to note within the various classes where\ncertain things are likely to be protected by patents.\n\n<H4>License<\/H4>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nAny person wishing to distribute modifications to the Software is\nasked to send the modifications to the original developer so that they\ncan be incorporated into the canonical version.

We've been hacking on this code for a while now and most of it seems to work pretty well.  But, there surely are some bugs floating around.  Sometimes things work fine on one computer platform but not so fine on another.  FPU overflows and underflows cause <I>very<\/I> weird behavior that also depends on the particular CPU and OS.
