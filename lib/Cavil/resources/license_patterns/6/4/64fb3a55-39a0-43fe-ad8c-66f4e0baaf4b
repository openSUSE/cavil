THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY\nCOPYRIGHT AND\/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS\nAUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE\nBOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS\nCONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND\nCONDITIONS.\n1. Definitions\n   a. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or\n      encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along\n      with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and\n      independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A\n      work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a\n      Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n   b. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and\n      other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,\n      dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,\n      art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which\n      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that\n      constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work\n      for the purpose of this License.\n   c. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the\n      terms of this License.\n   d. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n   e. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms\n      of this License.\n   f. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License\n      who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to\n      the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\n      exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or\nrestrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on\nthe exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other\napplicable laws.\n3. License Grant & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this\nLicense, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise\nthe rights in the Work as stated below on the conditions as stated below:\n   a. Re-creativity permitted. You may create and reproduce Derivative Works,\n      provided that:\n         i. the Derivative Work(s) constitute a good-faith partial or\n            recombined usage employing \"sampling,\" \"collage,\" \"mash-up,\" or\n            other comparable artistic technique, whether now known or hereafter\n            devised, that is highly transformative of the original, as\n            appropriate to the medium, genre, and market niche; and\n        ii. Your Derivative Work(s) must only make a partial use of the\n            original Work, or if You choose to use the original Work as a\n            whole, You must either use the Work as an insubstantial portion of\n            Your Derivative Work(s) or transform it into something\n            substantially different from the original Work. In the case of a\n            musical Work and\/or audio recording, the mere synchronization\n            (\"synching\") of the Work with a moving image shall not be\n            considered a transformation of the Work into something\n            substantially different.\n   b. You may distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\n      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission,\n      any Derivative Work(s) authorized under this License.\n   c. Prohibition on advertising. All advertising and promotional uses are\n      excluded from the above rights, except for advertisement and promotion of\n      the Derivative Work(s) that You are creating from the Work and Yourself\n      as the author thereof.\n   d. Noncommercial sharing of verbatim copies permitted.\n         i. You may reproduce the Work, incorporate the Work into one or more\n            Collective Works, and reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n            Collective Works. You may distribute copies or phonorecords of,\n            display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means\n            of a digital audio transmission the Work including or incorporated\n            in Collective Works.\n        ii. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in the\n            paragraph immediately above in any manner that is primarily\n            intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private\n            monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other\n            copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise\n            shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward\n            commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided\n            there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with\n            the exchange of copyrighted works.\n   e. Attribution and Notice.\n         i. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n            digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective\n            Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n            give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means\n            You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if\n            applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the\n            Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the\n            Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be\n            associated with the Work or a Derivative Work, unless such Uniform\n            Resource Identifier does not refer to the copyright notice or\n            licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative\n            Work, provide a credit identifying the use of the Work in the\n            Derivative Work (e.g., \"Remix of the Work by Original Author,\" or\n            \"Inclusion of a portion of the Work by Original Author in\n            collage\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n            provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or\n            Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any\n            other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least\n            as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n        ii. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform or publicly\n            digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License,\n            and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier\n            for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work or\n            Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,\n            or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any\n            terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License\n            or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You\n            may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that\n            refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may\n            not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n            digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that\n            control access of use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the\n            terms of this License. The above applies to the Work as\n            incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the\n            Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to\n            the terms of this License. Upon notice from any Licensor You must,\n            to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work or\n            Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original\n            Author, as requested.\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or\nhereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such\nmodifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other\nmedia and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby\nreserved.\n4. Disclaimer\nUNLESS SPECIFIED OTHERWISE BY THE PARTIES IN A SEPARATE WRITING, LICENSOR\nOFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR\nOTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE.\n5. Limitation on Liability.\nIN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS\nLICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n6. Termination\n   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n      Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective\n      Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n      terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n      compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 will\n      survive any termination of this License.\n   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n      perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n      Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n      Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n      any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n      withdraw this License (or any other license that has been granted under\n      the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force\n      and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n7. Miscellaneous\n   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a\n      Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\n      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\n      this License.\n   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,\n      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the\n      same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\n      License.\n   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n      remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the\n      parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the\n      minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n      consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed\n      by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n      respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n      agreements, or representations with respect to the Work, and with respect\n      to the subject matter hereof, not specified above. Licensor shall not be\n      bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication\n      from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n      agreement of the Licensor and You","risk":4,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"64fb3a55-39a0-43fe-ad8c-66f4e0baaf4b"}
