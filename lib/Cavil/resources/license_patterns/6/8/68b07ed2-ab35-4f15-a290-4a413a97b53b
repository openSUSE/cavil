GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n    reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n    distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and\n    such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n    Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n    transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n    object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the\n    Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by\n    the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination\n    to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to\n    any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n    licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n    to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n    Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n    intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims\n    any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on\n    infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n    exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n    assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n    needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to\n    allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\n    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license\n    set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\nown license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\n    conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title\n    and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability\n    and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n    damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\n    damages, such as lost profits;\n\n    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\n    by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,\n    and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through\n    a medium customarily used for software exchange. \n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\nany, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\noriginator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\na Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nContributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\nand costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\nactions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\nextent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\nconnection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.\nThe obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to\nany actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify,\nan Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor \nn writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related\nsettlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\nCommercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\nrelated to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial\nContributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial\nContributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related\nto those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\nand distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise\nof rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs\nof program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\nprograms or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\nSTRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY\nWAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\nlaw, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\nterms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\nprovision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\nprovision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\na patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\nlawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\nunder this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\nIn addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\nSection 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply\nwith any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure\nsuch failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such\nnoncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient\nagrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably\npracticable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any\nlicenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive","risk":4,"spdx":"CPL-1.0","trademark":0,"unique_id":"68b07ed2-ab35-4f15-a290-4a413a97b53b"}
