You can use it for\nyour libraries, too. \n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in\nnew free programs; and that you know you can do these things","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"617d003c-44dc-4dcc-95a9-2dac600af040"}
