By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\r\n* intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\r\n* make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\r\n* License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\r\n* to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\r\n* Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\r\n* Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n*\r\n* When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\r\n* Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\r\n* freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\r\n* service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\n* want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\n* free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n*\r\n* To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\r\n* to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\r\n* restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\n* distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n*\r\n* For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\r\n* or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\r\n* You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\r\n* And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n*\r\n* We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n* (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\n* distribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n*\r\n* Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\n* that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\n* software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\n* want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\n* that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\n* authors' reputations.\r\n*\r\n* Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\n* We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\r\n* individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\r\n* proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\r\n* be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n*\r\n* The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\n* modification follow.\r\n*\r\n* TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n*\r\n* 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\r\n* notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\r\n* the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\r\n* to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\r\n* either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\r\n* to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\r\n* verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n* (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\r\n* \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n*\r\n* Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\n* covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\r\n* the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\r\n* covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\r\n* (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\r\n* is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n*\r\n* 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\r\n* code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\r\n* and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\r\n* and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\r\n* this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\r\n* recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n*\r\n* You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\n* you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n*\r\n* 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\r\n* it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\r\n* such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\r\n* that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n*\r\n*     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\r\n*     that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n*\r\n*     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole\r\n*     or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\r\n*     to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\r\n*     terms of this License.\r\n*\r\n*     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\r\n*     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in\r\n*     the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\r\n*     appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\r\n*     else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may\r\n*     redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user\r\n*     how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is\r\n*     interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work\r\n*     based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n*\r\n* These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\r\n* identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\r\n* can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n* themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n* sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\n* distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\r\n* the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\r\n* License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\r\n* whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n*\r\n* Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n* your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n* exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n* collective works based on the Program.\r\n*\r\n* In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\n* with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\r\n* storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\r\n* scope of this License.\r\n*\r\n* 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\r\n* Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections\r\n* 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n*\r\n*     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\r\n*     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\r\n*     above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n*\r\n*     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\r\n*     give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\r\n*     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\r\n*     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n*     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n*\r\n*     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\r\n*     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only\r\n*     for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\r\n*     object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\r\n*     Subsection b above.)\r\n*\r\n* The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\n* making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\r\n* means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\n* associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\r\n* compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\r\n* exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\r\n* normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\n* components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\n* which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\r\n* executable.\r\n*\r\n* If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\r\n* to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\r\n* the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\r\n* code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\r\n* along with the object code.\r\n*\r\n* 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\n* except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\r\n* to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\r\n* automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\r\n* who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\r\n* not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\r\n* full compliance.\r\n*\r\n* 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\n* signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\n* distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\r\n* prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\r\n* modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\n* Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\r\n* its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\r\n* Program or works based on it.\r\n*\r\n* 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\n* Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\n* original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\n* these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\r\n* on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\r\n* responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n*\r\n* 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\n* infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\n* conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\n* otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\n* excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\r\n* so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\r\n* any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\r\n* distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\r\n* not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\r\n* receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\r\n* could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\r\n* distribution of the Program.\r\n*\r\n* If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\n* any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\n* apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\n* circumstances.\r\n*\r\n* It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\n* patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\n* such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\n* integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\r\n* by public license practices. Many people have made generous\r\n* contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\r\n* system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\r\n* the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\r\n* software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\r\n* choice.\r\n*\r\n* This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\r\n* a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n*\r\n* 8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\n* certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\n* original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\r\n* add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\r\n* countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\r\n* not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\r\n* limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n*\r\n* 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\r\n* of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\r\n* be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\n* address new problems or concerns.\r\n*\r\n* Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\r\n* specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\n* later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\n* conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\n* the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\r\n* number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\r\n* Free Software Foundation.\r\n*\r\n* 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\n* programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\r\n* author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\r\n* Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\r\n* sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\r\n* two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\r\n* software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n*\r\n* NO WARRANTY\r\n*\r\n* 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\n* FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\r\n* OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\n* PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\r\n* EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\n* WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\r\n* ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\r\n* YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\r\n* NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n*\r\n* 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\n* WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\n* AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\r\n* DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\n* DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\r\n* (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\r\n* INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\r\n* THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\r\n* OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n*\r\n* END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n*\r\n* How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n*\r\n* If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\n* possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\n* free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\r\n* terms.\r\n*\r\n* To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\r\n* attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\r\n* the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n* \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n*\r\n*     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\r\n*     Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\r\n*\r\n*     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\r\n*     under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the\r\n*     Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your\r\n*     option) any later version.\r\n*\r\n*     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\r\n*     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n*     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General\r\n*     Public License for more details.\r\n*\r\n*     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\r\n*     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\r\n*     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\r\n*\r\n* Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n*\r\n* If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\n* when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n*\r\n*     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision\r\n*     comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is\r\n*     free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain\r\n*     conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n*\r\n* The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\r\n* appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\r\n* you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\r\n* could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n*\r\n* You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\n* school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\n* necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n*\r\n*     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\r\n*     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\n*\r\n*     signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\n*     Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n*\r\n* This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\r\n* into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\r\n* may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\r\n* with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\r\n* General Public License instead of this License.\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n* \"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2\r\n*\r\n* Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and\/or its affiliates\r\n* are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,\r\n* based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the\r\n* GNU Classpath Exception, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the\r\n* particular source file's header the words \"Oracle designates this particular\r\n* file as subject to the \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the\r\n* LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\r\n*   You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in\r\n* this software package. Some of those programs are provided under licenses\r\n* deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.\r\n* For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache License,\r\n* Version 2.0.  Such programs are licensed to you under their original licenses.\r\n*   Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the\r\n* Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits you\r\n* to use that code in combination with other independent modules not licensed\r\n* under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would not permit you to commingle\r\n* code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for\r\n* example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also containing Oracle's\r\n* GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.  Additionally, if you\r\n* were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it\r\n* applies and distribute the result, you would likely be required to license\r\n* some or all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well,\r\n* and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\r\n* included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath Exception could\r\n* therefore effectively compromise your ability to further distribute the package.\r\n*\r\n* Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer\r\n* skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or\r\n* making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed\r\n* and\/or involve the use of third party software.\r\n*\r\n* CLASSPATH EXCEPTION\r\n* Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a\r\n* combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU\r\n* General Public License version 2 cover the whole combination.\r\n*\r\n* As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\r\n* permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\r\n* executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and\r\n* to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,\r\n* provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and\r\n* conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module\r\n* which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this library,\r\n* you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not\r\n* obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception\r\n* statement from your version","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"6189022d-78b2-48a9-b4d0-438b2c7dbdef"}
