You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\nderived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from\nthe Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be\nconsidered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\nthat you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\nwhen you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\nfollowing:\n\n    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\n    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an\n    equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major network\n    archive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the\n    Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version\n    of the Package.\n\n    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\n    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\n    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\n    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\n    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\n    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n    e) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package\n       permission to make your modifications Freely Available\n       in some specific way.\n\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\nexecutable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\n    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\n    to get the Standard Version.\n\n    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\n    the Package with your modifications.\n\n    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\n    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\n    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n    e) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your\n       modifications, by mail order.\n\n5.

The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\noutput from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\nunder the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\nthem, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\nPackage.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\nPackage via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a\nbinary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\nneither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\nfall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\nnot represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\nPackage.\n\n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other\nlanguages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to\nemulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this\nPackage shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the\nequivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do\nnot change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the\nregression tests for the language.\n\n8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial\ndistribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package\nis embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's\ninterfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.\nSuch use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\n\n9.
