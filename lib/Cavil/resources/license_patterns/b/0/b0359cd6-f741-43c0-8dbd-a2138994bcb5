{"license":"any perm mark changes","opinion":0,"packname":"festival","patent":0,"pattern":"@cindex redistribution\nAs we feeel the core system has reached an acceptable level of maturity\nfrom 1.4.0 the basic system is released under a free lience, without the\ncommercial restrictions we imposed on early versions. The basic system\nhas been placed under an X11 type licence which as free licences go is\npretty free.  No GPL code is included in festival or the speech tools\nthemselves (though some auxiliary files are GPL'd e.g. the Emacs mode\nfor Festival).  We have deliberately choosen a licence that should be\ncompatible with our commercial partners and our free software users.\n\nHowever although the code is free, we still offer no warranties and no\nmaintenance.  We will continue to endeavor to fix bugs and answer\nqueries when can, but are not in a position to guarantee it.  We will\nconsider maintenance contracts and consultancy if desired, please\ncontacts us for details.\n\nAlso note that not all the voices and lexicons we distribute with\nfestival are free.  Particularly the British English lexicon derived\nfrom Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary is free only for\nnon-commercial use (we will release an alternative soon).  Also the\nSpanish diphone voice we relase is only free for non-commercial use.\n\nIf you are using Festival or the speech tools in commercial environment,\neven though no licence is required, we would be grateful if you let us\nknow as it helps justify ourselves to our various sponsors.\n\nThe current copyright on the core system is\n@example\n          The Festival Speech Synthesis System: version 1.4.3\n                Centre for Speech Technology Research                  \n                     University of Edinburgh, UK                       \n                      Copyright (c) 1996-2004                            \n                        All Rights Reserved.                           \n                                                                       \n  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to use and distribute \n  this software and its documentation without restriction, including  \n  without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, \n  distribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of this work, and to     \n  permit persons to whom this work is furnished to do so, subject to  \n  the following conditions:                                           \n   1.
