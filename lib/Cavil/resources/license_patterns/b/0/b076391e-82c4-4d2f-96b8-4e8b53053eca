So, anything released as part of the ATLAS tarfile will need a BSDcompatible license, but you could \r\nthen issue the code yourself under a different license.\r\nAlternatively, you can provide your codes as “patches” to standard ATLAS, and thus avoid\r\nthe license issue altogether, at the cost of not being part of the standard tarfile. Even if you\r\ndecide not to license your contribution in a way that the ATLAS group can redistribute,\r\nsubmitting it to the mailing list is still recommended.
