When the\nDocument is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in\nthe aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,\nthen if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover\nTexts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must\nappear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\nTRANSLATION\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the\nDocument under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations\nrequires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations\nof some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant\nSections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in\nthe Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original\nEnglish version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In\ncase of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a\nnotice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, or “History”,\nthe requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing\nthe actual title.\nTERMINATION\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\nit is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\nand finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to\nnotify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the\ncopyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first\ntime you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright\nholder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n\fAppendix I: GNU Free Documentation License\n\n77\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties\nwho have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been\nterminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same\nmaterial does not give you any rights to use it.\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\npresent version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http:\/\/\nwww.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document\nspecifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or any later version” applies\nto it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified\nversion or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may\nchoose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nDocument specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be\nused, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Document.\n11. RELICENSING\n“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World Wide Web\nserver that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody\nto edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A\n“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any set of\ncopyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published\nby Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of\nbusiness in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license\npublished by that same organization.\n“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of\nanother Document.\nAn MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that\nwere first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently\nincorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,\nand (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BYSA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for\nrelicensing.\n\n\fAppendix I: GNU Free Documentation License\n\n78\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document\nand put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\nCopyright (C) year your name.\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\nor any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\nwith no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover\nTexts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ‘‘GNU\nFree Documentation License’’.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the\n“with. . . Texts.” line with this:\nwith the Invariant Sections being list their titles, with\nthe Front-Cover Texts being list, and with the Back-Cover Texts\nbeing list.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three,\nmerge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing\nthese examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General\nPublic License, to permit their use in free software.\n\n\f79","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b79a4167-60a8-4cc8-9813-7a7f701c6752"}
