For legal entities,\r\n   the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are\r\n   controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered\r\n   to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\"\r\n   means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or\r\n   management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii)\r\n   ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)\r\n   beneficial ownership of such entity.  \"Contribution\" shall mean any original\r\n   work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing\r\n   work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project Leads for\r\n   inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products managed or maintained\r\n   by the Project Leads (the \"Work\").

If any entity institutes\r\n   patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim\r\n   or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work\r\n   to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent\r\n   infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this\r\n   Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such\r\n   litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.
