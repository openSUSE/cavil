(It \nsays \"distribute and use\", but not \"modify\".)\n\n  ===================================================================\n  Distribute and use freely; there are no restrictions on further\n  dissemination and usage except those imposed by the laws of your\n  country of residence.  This software is provided \"as is\" without\n  warranty of fitness for use or suitability for any purpose, express\n  or implied. Use at your own risk or not at all.\n  ===================================================================\n\n  Incorporating the code into commercial products is permitted; you do\n  not have to make source available or contribute your changes back\n  (though that would be nice).\n\n  --amk                                                    (www.amk.ca)\n\nFor the next PyCrypto release, I would like to take steps to move toward a \nclearer licensing regime.  I am asking as many copyright holders as I can \nfind if I can release PyCrypto under something clearer and more standard.  \nBelow, I have quoted a public domain dedication that was recommended in \n_Intellectual Property and Open Source: A Practical Guide to Protecting \nCode_, by Van Lindberg.  I have already contacted A. M. Kuchling, Robey \nPointer, and Wim Lewis, and they have all approved the following dedication \nfor their contributions.\n\nI understand that you have made contributions to PyCrypto.  May I, on your \nbehalf, dedicate to the public domain all your contributions to PyCrypto, \nwith the following notice?\n\n  =======================================================================\n  The contents of this file are dedicated to the public domain.
