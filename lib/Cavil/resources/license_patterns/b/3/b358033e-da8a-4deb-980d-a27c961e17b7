{"license":"LGPL-2.1+","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"b 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary\nGNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of\nthe Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to\nthis License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version\nthan version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared,\nthen you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make\nany other change in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the\nLibrary into a program that is not a library.\n\n\\b 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a\nportion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or\nexecutable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that\nyou accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute\nthe source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy\nthe source along with the object code.\n\n\\b 5. A program that contains no derivative of any\nportion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by\nbeing compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the\nLibrary&quot;.  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the\nLibrary, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the\nlibrary&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section\n6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\nWhen a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether\nor not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n\\b 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\nlink a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to\nproduce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that\nwork under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n\\b a) Accompany the work\nwith the complete corresponding  machine-readable source code for the\nLibrary including whatever  changes were used in the work (which must\nbe distributed under  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an\nexecutable linked  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable\n&quot;work that  uses the Library&quot;, as object code and\/or source code, so\nthat the  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a\nmodified  executable containing the modified Library.  (It is\nunderstood  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files\nin the  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the\napplication  to use the modified definitions.)\n\n\\b b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid\nfor at  least three years, to give the same user the materials\nspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more  than the cost\nof performing this distribution.\n\n\\b c) If distribution of the work is made by offering\naccess to copy  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to\ncopy the above  specified materials from the same place.\n\n\\b d) Verify that the user has already received a copy\nof these  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that\nuses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components\n(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the\nexecutable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n\\b 7. You may place library facilities that are a work\nbased on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with\nother library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\nsuch a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the\nwork based on the Library and of the other library facilities is\notherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n\\b a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the\nsame work  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\nfacilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the  Sections\nabove.\n\n\\b b) Give prominent notice with the combined library\nof the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and\nexplaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same\nwork.\n\n\n\\b 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense,\nlink with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under\nthis License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link\nwith, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have\nreceived copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\ncompliance.\n\n\\b 9. You are not required to accept this License,\nsince you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you\npermission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based\non the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n\\b 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any\nwork based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a\nlicense from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or\nmodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not\nimpose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\nby third parties to this License.\n\n\\b 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or\nallegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited\nto patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\norder, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\nLicense, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,\nthen as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For\nexample, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly\nor indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it\nand this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\nLibrary.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\nunder any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is\nintended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in\nother circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented\nby public license practices.  Many people have made generous\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\nsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up\nto the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\nsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed\nto be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n\\b 12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library\nis restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted\ninterfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under\nthis License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or\namong countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n\\b 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish\nrevised and\/or new versions of the Library General Public License from\ntime to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\npresent version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\nconcerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nLibrary specifies a version number of this License which applies to it\nand &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n\\b 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library\ninto other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\nwith these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software\nwhich is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n\\par NO WARRANTY\n\n\\b 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\nOF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\\b 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nOR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY\nWHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\nLIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\nOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n\\par END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\\htmlonly\n<hr>\n<table summary=\"navigation bar\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\n<tr","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b358033e-da8a-4deb-980d-a27c961e17b7"}
