It is numbered 2\r\nbecause it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\r\nshare and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are\r\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\r\nmake sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially\r\ndesignated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries\r\nwhose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\r\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\r\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you\r\nwish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you\r\ncan change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\r\nyou know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to\r\ndeny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\r\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for\r\na fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You\r\nmust make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you\r\nlink a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to\r\nthe recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making\r\nchanges to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these\r\nterms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the\r\nlibrary, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to\r\ncopy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that\r\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If\r\nthe library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its\r\nrecipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that\r\nany problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\r\nreputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We\r\nwish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will\r\nindividually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the\r\nprogram into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear\r\nthat any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\r\nGeneral Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This\r\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\r\ndesignated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary\r\none; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\r\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\r\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\r\nprogram and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without\r\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\r\nanalogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in\r\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\r\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\r\ntreats it as such.\r\n\r\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public\r\nLicense for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because\r\nmost developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker\r\nconditions might promote sharing better.\r\n\r\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users\r\nof those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries\r\nthemselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit\r\ndevelopers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving\r\nyour freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that\r\nare incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards\r\nchanges in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the\r\nactual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster\r\ndevelopment of free libraries.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\r\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\r\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code\r\nderived from the library, while the latter only works together with the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\r\nGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a\r\n   notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying\r\n   it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public\r\n   License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as\r\n   \"you\".\r\n\r\n   A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\r\n   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which\r\n   has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\"\r\n   means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\n   that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either\r\n   verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into\r\n   another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\r\n   limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n   \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\r\n   modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the\r\n   source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\r\n   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\r\n   installation of the library.\r\n\r\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\n   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\r\n   a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a\r\n   program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\n   Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing\r\n   it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the\r\n   program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete\r\n   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\n   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\n   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\r\n   that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and\r\n   distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\n   you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,\r\n   thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such\r\n   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that\r\n   you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n\r\n   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating\r\n      that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to\r\n      all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table\r\n      of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the\r\n      facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\r\n      invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in\r\n      the event an application does not supply such function or table, the\r\n      facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose\r\n      remains meaningful.\r\n\r\n   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a\r\n   purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n   application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\n   application-supplied function or table used by this function must be\r\n   optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root\r\n   function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\r\n   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and\r\n   can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n   sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\n   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\r\n   the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\r\n   License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\r\n   whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n   collective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\n   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a\r\n   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\r\n   scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\n   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do\r\n   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that\r\n   they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\n   instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\n   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\n   that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these\r\n   notices.\r\n\r\n   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that\r\n   copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\n   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the\r\n   Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of\r\n   it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\r\n   of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the\r\n   complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\r\n   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n   customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\r\n   designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\r\n   code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the\r\n   source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the\r\n   source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but\r\n   is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with\r\n   it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation,\r\n   is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the\r\n   scope of this License.\r\n\r\n   However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates\r\n   an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains\r\n   portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\r\n   library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6\r\n   states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\r\n   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\n   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is\r\n   not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\r\n   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The\r\n   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\n   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure\r\n   layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten\r\n   lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is\r\n   unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\r\n   work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\r\n   Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\n   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section\r\n   6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\r\n   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a\r\n   \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work\r\n   containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms\r\n   of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work\r\n   for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such\r\n   modifications.\r\n\r\n   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\n   this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during\r\n   execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright\r\n   notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the\r\n   user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n\r\n   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in\r\n      the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);\r\n      and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the\r\n      complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object\r\n      code and\/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and\r\n      then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified\r\n      Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of\r\n      definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to\r\n      recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\r\n\r\n   b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n      years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection\r\n      6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this\r\n      distribution.\r\n\r\n   c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\r\n      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\r\n      materials from the same place.\r\n\r\n   d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials\r\n      or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n\r\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\"\r\n   must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the\r\n   executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code\r\n   distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in\r\n   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\r\n   kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,\r\n   unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\n   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions\r\n   of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the\r\n   operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them\r\n   and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\r\n   side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities\r\n   not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,\r\n   provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library\r\n   and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided\r\n   that you do these two things:\r\n\r\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on\r\n      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must\r\n      be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\n\r\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part\r\n      of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find\r\n      the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\r\n   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\r\n   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\r\n   Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\r\n   License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you\r\n   under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as\r\n   such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed\r\n   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute\r\n   the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law\r\n   if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\r\n   distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you\r\n   indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and\r\n   conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works\r\n   based on it.\r\n\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\n    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\n    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\n    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\r\n    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\r\n    herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\r\n    parties to this License.\r\n\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\n    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\n    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\n    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\n    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\r\n    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\n    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\n    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license\r\n    would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all\r\n    those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\r\n    only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\r\n    entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\n    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\n    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\n    apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\n    circumstances.\r\n\r\n    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\n    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\n    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\n    integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented\r\n    by public license practices. Many people have made generous\r\n    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\r\n    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up\r\n    to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\r\n    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\r\n    choice.\r\n\r\n    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\n    be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\r\n    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\r\n    copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an\r\n    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\r\n    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\r\n    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\r\n    limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\r\n    the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions\r\n    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\r\n    detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\r\n    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\n    later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\n    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license\r\n    version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\r\n    Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\n    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\n    write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\r\n    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software\r\n    Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be\r\n    guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all\r\n    derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\r\n    of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\n    FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\r\n    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\n    PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\r\n    EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\n    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\r\n    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH\r\n    YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\r\n    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\n    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR\r\n    REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\r\n    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\n    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\r\n    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\r\n    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\r\n    THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\r\n    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\r\neveryone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting\r\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\r\nordinary General Public License).\r\n\r\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is\r\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) year name of author\r\n\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\r\nunder the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your\r\noption) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\r\nANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Library General Public\r\nLicense for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public License\r\nalong with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,\r\nInc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\r\nnecessary.
