PREAMBLE\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure\neveryone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being\nconsidered responsible for modifications made by others.\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the\nsame sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not\nlimited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a\nprinted book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\nThis License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the\npublic is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\".\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,\nor with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the\nrelationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains\nnothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,\na Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the\nsubject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in\nthe notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is\navailable to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text\neditors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,\nand that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text\nformatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\nsubsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LATEX\ninput format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human\nmodification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary\nword processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machinegenerated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the\nmaterial this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title\nPage\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\n61\n\n\fE GNU Free Documentation License\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this\nLicense, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies,\nand that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct\nor control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in\nexchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\nIf you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover\nTexts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the\nfront cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher\nof these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may\nadd other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of\nthe Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machinereadable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computernetwork location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general networkusing public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\nTransparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number\nof copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided\nthat you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document,\nthus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must\ndo these things in the Modified Version:\n• A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous\nversions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title\nas a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n• B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in\nthe Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if\nit has less than five).\n• C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\n• D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n• E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n• F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified\nVersion under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n• G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s\nlicense notice.\n• H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n62\n\n\fE GNU Free Documentation License\n• I. Preserve the section entitled \"History\", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\npublisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled \"History\" in the Document,\ncreate one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item","risk":1,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"bb2863b7-c33c-4e7c-8626-64dda7c4169e"}
