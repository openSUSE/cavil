You should also\n  announce your new status to the same pertinent community as\n  in~\\ref{intention} above.\n\n  \\LPPLsubsection{Whether and How to Distribute Works under This License}\n\n  This section contains important instructions, examples, and\n  recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\n  works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\n  this section.\n\n  \\LPPLsubsubsection{Choosing This License or Another License}\n\n  If for any part of your work you want or need to use\n  \\emph{distribution} conditions that differ significantly from those\n  in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your\n  work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license.\n  You may use the text of this license as a model for your own\n  license, but your license should not refer to the \\LPPL\\ or\n  otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under\n  the \\LPPL.\n\n  The document \\LPPLdocfile{modguide} in the base \\LaTeX\\ distribution\n  explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It\n  explains, for example, why distributing \\LaTeX\\ under the\n  \\textsc{gnu} General Public License (\\textsc{gpl}) was considered\n  inappropriate.  Even if your work is unrelated to \\LaTeX, the\n  discussion in \\LPPLdocfile{modguide} may still be relevant, and authors\n  intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged\n  to read it.\n\n  \\LPPLsubsubsection{A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution}\n\n  It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your\n  own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\n  distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that\n  such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen\n  by accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component;\n  or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the\n  modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the\n  conditions of this license in ways that could have legal\n  implications and, worse, cause problems for the community.  It is\n  therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the\n  Work identical with the public one.  Many works provide ways to\n  control the behavior of that work without altering any of its\n  licensed components.\n\n  \\LPPLsubsubsection{How to Use This License}\n\n  To use this license, place in each of the components of your work\n  both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year\n  the work was authored and\/or last substantially modified.  Include\n  also a statement that the distribution and\/or modification of that\n  component is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\n  Here is an example of such a notice and statement:\n  \\begin{verbatim}\n  %% pig.dtx\n  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name\n  %\n  % This work may be distributed and\/or modified under the\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n  % The latest version of this license is in\n  %   http:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/lppl.txt\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n  % version 2005\/12\/01 or later.\n  %\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.\n  % \n  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\n  %\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\n  \\end{verbatim}\n  \n  Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in\n  this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring to the\n  three files `\\LPPLfile{pig.dtx}', `\\LPPLfile{pig.ins}', and\n  `\\LPPLfile{pig.sty}' (the last being generated from\n  `\\LPPLfile{pig.dtx}' using `\\LPPLfile{pig.ins}'), the `Base\n  Interpreter' referring to any `\\LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright\n  Holder' and `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y.\n  Name'.\n\n  If you do not want the Maintenance section of \\LPPL\\ to apply to\n  your Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.\n  However, we recommend that you use `maintained' as the Maintenance\n  section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful\n  to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it\n  yourself.\n\n  \\LPPLsubsubsection{Derived Works That Are Not Replacements}\n\n  Several clauses of the \\LPPL\\ specify means to provide reliability\n  and stability for the user community. They therefore concern\n  themselves with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used\n  as a (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original\n  Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are\n  reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d\n  shall not apply.\n\n  \\LPPLsubsubsection{Important Recommendations}\n\n  \\LPPLparagraph{Defining What Constitutes the Work}\n\n  The \\LPPL\\ requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\n  files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a way\n  for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.  This\n  could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files\n  of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a\n  line such as:\n\n  \\begin{verbatim}\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n  \\end{verbatim}\n   \n  in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\n  impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\n  to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be\n  entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise\n  the Work","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"bbfb8bc5-10bb-489e-986a-273a8dfae568"}
