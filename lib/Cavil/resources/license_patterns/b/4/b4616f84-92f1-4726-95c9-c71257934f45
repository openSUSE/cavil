It is\r\n+ numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\r\n+\r\n+\t\t\t    Preamble\r\n+\r\n+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\r\n+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\n+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\r\n+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n+\r\n+  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\r\n+specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\r\n+other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\r\n+your libraries, too.\r\n+\r\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\n+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\n+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\n+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n+\r\n+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\n+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\n+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\r\n+you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\r\n+\r\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\r\n+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\r\n+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\r\n+code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\r\n+complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\r\n+with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\r\n+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n+\r\n+  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\r\n+the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\r\n+permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n+\r\n+  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\r\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\n+library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\n+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\r\n+version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\r\n+the original authors' reputations.\r\n+\f\r\n+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\n+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\r\n+software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\r\n+transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\r\n+we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\r\n+free use or not licensed at all.\r\n+\r\n+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\r\n+GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\r\n+license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\r\n+designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\r\n+one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\r\n+the same as in the ordinary license.\r\n+\r\n+  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\r\n+they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\r\n+program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\r\n+changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\r\n+analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\r\n+a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\r\n+derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\r\n+treats it as such.\r\n+\r\n+  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\r\n+Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\r\n+sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\r\n+concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\r\n+\r\n+  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\r\n+users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\r\n+libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\r\n+permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\r\n+preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\r\n+libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\r\n+this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\r\n+changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\r\n+will lead to faster development of free libraries.\r\n+\r\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\n+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\r\n+\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\r\n+former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\r\n+works together with the library.\r\n+\r\n+  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\r\n+General Public License rather than by this special one.\r\n+\f\r\n+\t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n+\r\n+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\r\n+contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\r\n+party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\r\n+General Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\r\n+addressed as \"you\".\r\n+\r\n+  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\r\n+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n+\r\n+  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\r\n+which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\r\n+Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\r\n+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\r\n+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\r\n+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\r\n+included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n+\r\n+  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\n+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\r\n+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\n+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\r\n+and installation of the library.\r\n+\r\n+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\n+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\r\n+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\r\n+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\r\n+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\r\n+and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n+  \r\n+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\r\n+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\r\n+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\r\n+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\r\n+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\r\n+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\r\n+Library.\r\n+\r\n+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\r\n+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\r\n+fee.\r\n+\f\r\n+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\r\n+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\r\n+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\n+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n+\r\n+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n+\r\n+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\r\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n+\r\n+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\n+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n+\r\n+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\r\n+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\r\n+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\r\n+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\r\n+    in the event an application does not supply such function or\r\n+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\r\n+    its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n+\r\n+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\r\n+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\n+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\r\n+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\r\n+    root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n+\r\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\n+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\n+it.\r\n+\r\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n+collective works based on the Library.\r\n+\r\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\n+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\r\n+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\n+the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\n+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\r\n+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\r\n+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\n+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\n+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\n+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\r\n+these notices.\r\n+\f\r\n+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\r\n+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\n+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n+\r\n+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\r\n+the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n+\r\n+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\r\n+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\r\n+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\r\n+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\r\n+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\r\n+medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n+\r\n+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\r\n+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\r\n+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\r\n+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\r\n+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n+\r\n+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\n+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\r\n+linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\r\n+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\r\n+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\r\n+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\r\n+contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\r\n+library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\r\n+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n+\r\n+  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\r\n+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\n+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\n+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\r\n+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\r\n+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n+\r\n+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\n+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\r\n+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\r\n+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\r\n+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\r\n+Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n+\r\n+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\n+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\r\n+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\r\n+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n+\f\r\n+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\r\n+link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\r\n+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\r\n+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\r\n+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\r\n+engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n+\r\n+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\n+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\n+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\r\n+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\r\n+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\r\n+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\r\n+of these things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\n+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\r\n+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\r\n+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\r\n+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\r\n+    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\r\n+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\n+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\r\n+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\r\n+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\r\n+    to use the modified definitions.)\r\n+\r\n+    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\r\n+    least three years, to give the same user the materials\r\n+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\r\n+    than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n+\r\n+    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\r\n+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\r\n+    specified materials from the same place.\r\n+\r\n+    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\n+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n+\r\n+  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\r\n+Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\r\n+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\r\n+the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\r\n+distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\n+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\n+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\n+the executable.\r\n+\r\n+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\n+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\n+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\r\n+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\r\n+distribute.\r\n+\f\r\n+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\n+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\r\n+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\r\n+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\r\n+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\r\n+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\r\n+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\r\n+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\r\n+    Sections above.\r\n+\r\n+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\r\n+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\r\n+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n+\r\n+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\r\n+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\r\n+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\r\n+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\r\n+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\r\n+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\n+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n+\r\n+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\n+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\n+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\n+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\n+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\n+the Library or works based on it.\r\n+\r\n+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\n+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\n+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\n+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\n+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\n+this License.\r\n+\f\r\n+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\n+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\n+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\r\n+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\r\n+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\n+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n+\r\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\n+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\r\n+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n+\r\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\n+integrity of the free software distribution system which is\r\n+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\n+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\n+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\n+system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\n+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\n+impose that choice.\r\n+\r\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\n+be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\n+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\r\n+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\n+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\n+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\n+written in the body of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\r\n+versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\r\n+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\n+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n+\r\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\r\n+\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\n+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\r\n+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.\r\n+\f\r\n+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\n+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\n+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\r\n+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\r\n+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\r\n+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\r\n+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\n+and reuse of software generally.\r\n+\r\n+\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\r\n+\r\n+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\n+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\r\n+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\r\n+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\n+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\n+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\r\n+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n+\r\n+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\n+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\n+AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\r\n+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\r\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\r\n+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\n+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\n+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\r\n+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\n+DAMAGES.\r\n+\r\n+\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n+\f\r\n+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n+\r\n+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\n+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\r\n+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\r\n+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\r\n+ordinary General Public License).\r\n+\r\n+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\r\n+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\n+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n+\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n+\r\n+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n+\r\n+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\n+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\r\n+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\n+    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n+\r\n+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
