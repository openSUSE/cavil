Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute\nverbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of\nthe Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that\nyou receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the\nsoftware or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do\nthese things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show\nthem these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer\nyou this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or\nmodify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain\npatent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we\nhave made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or\nnot licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND\nMODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\ninto another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also\nmeet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you\nchanged the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in\npart contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed\nas a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\nmust cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\nway, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright\nnotice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\nwarranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\nand telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\nyour work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\nand its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as\nseparate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole\nwhich is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on\nthe terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to\nwork written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control\nthe distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\nabove provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\ncode, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any\nthird party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source\ndistribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source\ncode, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute\ncorresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial\ndistribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable\nform with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\nfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\nexecutable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\nnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)\nwith the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system\non which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long\nas such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept\nthis License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work\nbased on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\nProgram or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,\ndistribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You\nmay not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\ngranted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties\nto this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on\nyou (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\nunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\nyou may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\nnot permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive\ncopies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy\nboth it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\nProgram.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular\ncircumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as\na whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other\nproperty right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has\nthe sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution\nsystem, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have\nmade generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through\nthat system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the\nauthor\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any\nother system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries\neither by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who\nplaces the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\nonly in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\nconcerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\nversion number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you\nhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of\nany later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does\nnot specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all\nderivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\nsoftware generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS\nNO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED\nTO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY\nWHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS\nPERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY\nOTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Artistic License\n\nPreamble\n\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package\nmay be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of\nartistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the\npackage the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary\nfashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n-    \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright\n     Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual\n     modification. \n-    \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,\n     or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright\n     Holder. \n-    \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for\n     the package. \n-    \"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n-    \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of\n     media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You\n     will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the\n     computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) \n-    \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though\n     there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that\n     recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they\n     received it. \n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from\nthe Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a\nway shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\nthat you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when\nyou changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise\n     make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications\n     to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on\n     a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the\n     Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard\n     Version of the Package.\n\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or","risk":2,"spdx":"Artistic-1.0-Perl OR GPL-1.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b89bc0e4-fc8c-43bd-b82e-ae7ba182b588"}
