{"license":"","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License \r\nwhere the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n\r\nSection 5  Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n    Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed \r\nMaterial as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, \r\nwhether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, \r\nfitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or \r\nabsence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or \r\nin part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\r\n    To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, \r\nnegligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other \r\nlosses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the \r\nLicensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability \r\nis not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n    The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to \r\nthe extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\nSection 6  Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n    This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail \r\nto comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\n\r\n    Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n        automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of \r\nthe violation; or\r\n        upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for \r\nYour violations of this Public License.\r\n    For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions \r\nor stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\n    Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\n\r\nSection 7  Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\n    The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly \r\nagreed.\r\n    Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from \r\nand independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\nSection 8  Interpretation.\r\n\r\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, \r\nor impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public \r\nLicense.\r\n    To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically \r\nreformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed \r\nfrom this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\r\n    No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly \r\nagreed to by the Licensor.\r\n    Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"b882c8e1-c820-49c6-9447-9326c3ad706f"}
