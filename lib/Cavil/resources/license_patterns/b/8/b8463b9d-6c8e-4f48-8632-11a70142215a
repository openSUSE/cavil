{"license":"OFL-1.1","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"7  ABOUT USING THE OFL FOR YOUR ORIGINAL FONTS\n\nIf you want to release your fonts under the OFL, you only need to do the following:\n\n7.1  Put your copyright and reserved font names information in the beginning of the main OFL file (simply use the dedicated placeholders).\n7.2  Put your copyright and the OFL references in your various font files (such as in the copyright, license and description fields) and in your other components (build scripts, glyph databases, documentation, rendering samples, etc). Accurate metadata in your font files is beneficial to you as an increasing number of applications are exposing this information to the user. For example, clickable links can bring users back to your website and let them know about other work you have done or services you provide. Depending on the format of your fonts and sources, you can use template human-readable headers or machine-readable metadata.\n7.3  Write an initial FONTLOG for your font and include it in the release package.\n7.4  Include the OFL license file in your release package.\n7.5  We also highly recommend you include the relevant practical documentation on the license by putting the OFL-FAQ in your package.\n7.6  If you wish, you can use the OFL Graphics on your web page.\n\nThat's all.
