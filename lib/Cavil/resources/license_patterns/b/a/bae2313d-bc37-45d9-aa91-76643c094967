Notwithstanding the foregoing, the party terminating this EULA, a license or a Service \r\nas permitted by any provision in this Section 7 shall incur no additional liability merely by virtue of such termination. \r\nTermination of this EULA, a license or a Service regardless of cause or nature, shall be without prejudice to any other \r\nrights or remedies of the parties and shall be without liability for any loss or damage occasioned thereby. \r\n7.3\tEffect of Expiration or Termination.

This EULA and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned, delegated or transferred by \r\nYou, in whole or in part, including by merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law, or any other manner, without \r\nwritten consent of NVIDIA, and any purported assignment in violation of this provision shall be void and of no effect. \r\nSubject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and \r\nassigns. \r\n8.2\tAudit. During the term of this EULA and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, You will maintain complete and \r\naccurate books and records regarding use of the Licensed Software and Your performance and administration of this EULA. \r\n During such period, NVIDIA or its authorized third party auditors will have the right to inspect and audit Your Enterprise \r\nbooks and records for the purpose of confirming Your compliance with the terms of this EULA. Any such inspection and \r\naudit will be conducted during regular business hours and in a manner that minimizes interference with Your normal business \r\nactivities. If such an inspection and audit reveals an underpayment of any amounts payable to NVIDIA, then You will \r\npromptly remit the full amount of such underpayment to NVIDIA, including interest that will accrue (without the requirement \r\nof a notice) at the lower of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permissible by law. If the underpaid amount exceeds \r\nfive percent (5%) of the amounts payable to NVIDIA for the period audited and\/or such an inspection and audit reveals \r\na material non-conformance with the terms of this EULA, then You will also pay NVIDIA’s reasonable costs of conducting \r\nthe inspection and audit. Further, You agree that the party delivering the Licensed Software to You may collect and \r\ndisclose to NVIDIA (subject to confidentiality obligations) information for NVIDIA to verify Your compliance with the \r\nterms of this EULA including (without limitation) information regarding Your usage of the Licensed Software. \r\n8.3\tGoverning Law; Jurisdictions.

The prevailing party in any action to enforce this EULA shall be entitled to recover \r\ncosts and expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees. \r\n8.4\tNonexclusive Remedy.  Except as expressly set forth in this EULA, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies \r\nunder this EULA will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this EULA or otherwise. \r\n8.5\tInjunctive Relief. The parties agree that a material breach of any of the promises or agreements contained in this \r\nEULA adversely affecting NVIDIA’s Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensed Software may result in irreparable \r\nand continuing injury to NVIDIA for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and NVIDIA is therefore entitled \r\nto seek injunctive relief as well as such other and further relief as may be appropriate. \r\n8.6\tConflicts; Order of Precedence.  Any printed or other terms and conditions on an Order or similar order document \r\nconflicting and\/or in addition with the terms and conditions of this EULA or its exhibits and addenda shall be of no \r\nforce or effect. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between any exhibit and this EULA, the conflict or inconsistency \r\nshall be resolved in favor of this EULA. \r\n8.7\tWaiver.

Any waiver will be effective only if in writing and \r\nsigned by duly authorized representatives of each party. \r\n8.8\tSeverability. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this EULA invalid or unenforceable, \r\nthat provision of the EULA will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, \r\nand the other provisions of this EULA will remain in full force and effect. \r\n8.9\tU.S. Government Legend.
