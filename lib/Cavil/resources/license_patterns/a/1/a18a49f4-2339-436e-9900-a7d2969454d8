Likewise for a collection of short\ndocuments--you only need one copy of the GNU FDL for the whole\ncollection.  For a single short document, you can use a very permissive\nnon-copyleft license, to avoid taking up space with a long license.\n\n   See `http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/fdl-howto.html' for more explanation\nof how to employ the GFDL.\n\n   Note that it is not obligatory to include a copy of the GNU GPL or\nGNU LGPL in a manual whose license is neither the GPL nor the LGPL.  It\ncan be a good idea to include the program's license in a large manual;\nin a short manual, whose size would be increased considerably by\nincluding the program's license, it is probably better not to include\nit.\n\n\u001f\nFile: standards.info,  Node: Manual Credits,  Next: Printed Manuals,  Prev: License for Manuals,  Up: Documentation\n\n6.5 Manual Credits\n==================\n\nPlease credit the principal human writers of the manual as the authors,\non the title page of the manual.  If a company sponsored the work, thank\nthe company in a suitable place in the manual, but do not cite the\ncompany as an author.\n\n\u001f\nFile: standards.info,  Node: Printed Manuals,  Next: NEWS File,  Prev: Manual Credits,  Up: Documentation\n\n6.6 Printed Manuals\n===================\n\nThe FSF publishes some GNU manuals in printed form.  To encourage sales\nof these manuals, the on-line versions of the manual should mention at\nthe very start that the printed manual is available and should point at\ninformation for getting it--for instance, with a link to the page\n`http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/order\/order.html'.  This should not be included in\nthe printed manual, though, because there it is redundant.\n\n   It is also useful to explain in the on-line forms of the manual how\nthe user can print out the manual from the sources.\n\n\u001f\nFile: standards.info,  Node: NEWS File,  Next: Change Logs,  Prev: Printed Manuals,  Up: Documentation\n\n6.7 The NEWS File\n=================\n\nIn addition to its manual, the package should have a file named `NEWS'\nwhich contains a list of user-visible changes worth mentioning.  In\neach new release, add items to the front of the file and identify the\nversion they pertain to.  Don't discard old items; leave them in the\nfile after the newer items.  This way, a user upgrading from any\nprevious version can see what is new.\n\n   If the `NEWS' file gets very long, move some of the older items into\na file named `ONEWS' and put a note at the end referring the user to\nthat file.\n\n\u001f\nFile: standards.info,  Node: Change Logs,  Next: Man Pages,  Prev: NEWS File,  Up: Documentation\n\n6.8 Change Logs","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"a18a49f4-2339-436e-9900-a7d2969454d8"}
