Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring\n     solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a\n     copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than\n     this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.\n     These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.\n     Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your\n     acceptance of this License to do so.\n   <\/para>\n   <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n     10.

You are not responsible for enforcing\n     compliance by third parties with this License.\n   <\/para>\n   <para>\n     An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control\n     of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work\n     results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who\n     receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the\n     party&rsquo;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous\n     paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the\n     work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get\n     it with reasonable efforts.\n   <\/para>\n   <para>\n     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights\n     granted or affirmed under this License.

The\n    work thus licensed is called the contributor&rsquo;s &ldquo;contributor\n    version&rdquo;.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    A contributor&rsquo;s &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent\n    claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by\n    this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do\n    not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further\n    modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition,\n    &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a\n    manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n    license under the contributor&rsquo;s essential patent claims, to make, use,\n    sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the\n    contents of its contributor version.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any\n    express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a\n    patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not\n    to sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent\n    license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to\n    enforce a patent against the party.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the\n    Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free\n    of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available\n    network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)\n    cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive\n    yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or\n    (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\n    to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly\n    relying&rdquo; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent\n    license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your\n    recipient&rsquo;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one\n    or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe\n    are valid.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,\n    you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and\n    grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work\n    authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the\n    covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to\n    all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include\n    within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work\n    if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n    business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third\n    party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under\n    which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the\n    covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection\n    with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those\n    copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or\n    compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that\n    arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any\n    implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be\n    available to you under applicable patent law.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    12. No Surrender of Others&rsquo; Freedom.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\n    Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License\n    would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    13. Use with the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> Affero General Public License.\n  <\/bridgehead>\n  <para>\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to\n    link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the\n    <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> Affero General Public License into a single combined\n    work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will\n    continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special\n    requirements of the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> Affero General Public License,\n    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n    combination as such.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    14.

Such new\n    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\n    detail to address new problems or concerns.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n    specifies that a certain numbered version of the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym>\n    General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you\n    have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\n    numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n    Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n    <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> General Public License, you may choose any version\n    ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of\n    the <acronym>GNU<\/acronym> General Public License can be used, that\n    proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\n    authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n  <\/para>\n  <para>\n    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.\n    However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright\n    holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n  <\/para>\n  <bridgehead renderas=\"sect1\">\n    15.
