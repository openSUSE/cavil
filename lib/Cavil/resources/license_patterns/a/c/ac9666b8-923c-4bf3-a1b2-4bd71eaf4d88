Notwithstanding the foregoing, the party terminating this EULA, a license or a Service \r\nas permitted by any provision in this Section 7 shall incur no additional liability merely by virtue of such termination. \r\nTermination of this EULA, a license or a Service regardless of cause or nature, shall be without prejudice to any other \r\nrights or remedies of the parties and shall be without liability for any loss or damage occasioned thereby. \r\n7.3\tEffect of Expiration or Termination.
