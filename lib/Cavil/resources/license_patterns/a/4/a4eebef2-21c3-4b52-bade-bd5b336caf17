{"license":"any reference local","opinion":1,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"Licensing\n\n   The licence chosen by any free software project is one of the\n   foundational decisions that sets out how derivatives and contributions\n   can occur, and in turn what kind of community will form around the\n   project.\n\n   Using a licence that is compatible with other popular licences is a\n   powerful constraint because of the [4]network effects: the freedom to\n   share improvements between projects allows free software to reach\n   high-quality over time. Licence-proliferation leads to many\n   incompatible licences, undermining the network effect, the freedom to\n   share and ultimately making the libre movement that Ubuntu is a part of\n   less effective. For all kinds of software, writing a new licence is not\n   to be taken lightly and is a choice that needs to be thoroughly\n   justified if this path is taken.\n\n   Today it is not clear to Canonical what the best licence for a font\n   project like the Ubuntu Font Family is: one that starts life designed\n   by professionals and continues with the full range of community\n   development, from highly commercial work in new directions to curious\n   beginners' experimental contributions. The fast and steady pace of the\n   Ubuntu release cycle means that an interim libre licence has been\n   necessary to enable the consideration of the font family as part of\n   Ubuntu 10.10 operating system release.\n\n   Before taking any decision on licensing, Canonical as sponsor and\n   backer of the project has reviewed the many existing licenses used for\n   libre\/open fonts and engaged the stewards of the most popular licenses\n   in detailed discussions. The current interim licence is the first step\n   in progressing the state-of-the-art in licensing for libre\/open font\n   development.\n\n   The public discussion must now involve everyone in the (comparatively\n   new) area of the libre\/open font community; including font users,\n   software freedom advocates, open source supporters and existing libre\n   font developers. Most importantly, the minds and wishes of professional\n   type designers considering entering the free software business\n   community must be taken on board","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"a4eebef2-21c3-4b52-bade-bd5b336caf17"}
