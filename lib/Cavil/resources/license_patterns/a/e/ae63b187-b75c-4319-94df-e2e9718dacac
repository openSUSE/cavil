COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<\/B><\/FONT>\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"2\">Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, \r\nbusiness partners and the like.  While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the \r\nContributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create \r\npotential liability for other Contributors.   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product \r\noffering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor \r\n(\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits \r\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts \r\nor omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product \r\noffering.  The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual \r\nproperty infringement.  In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor \r\nin writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor \r\nin, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim \r\nat its own expense.<\/FONT>\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"2\"><\/FONT>\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"2\">For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. \r\n That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.  If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or \r\noffers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility \r\nalone.  Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related \r\nto those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, \r\nthe Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<\/FONT>\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"2\"><\/FONT><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#0000FF\"><\/FONT>\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#0000FF\"><\/FONT><FONT SIZE=\"2\"><B>5.
