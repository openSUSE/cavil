Additional Definitions.\r\n\r\nAs used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an\r\nApplication or a Combined Work as defined below.\r\n\r\nAn “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the\r\nLibrary, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass\r\nof a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface\r\nprovided by the Library.\r\n\r\nA “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application\r\nwith the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined\r\nWork was made is also called the “Linked Version”.\r\n\r\nThe “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding\r\nSource for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the\r\nCombined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and\r\nnot on the Linked Version.\r\n\r\nThe “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code\r\nand\/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs\r\nneeded for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the\r\nSystem Libraries of the Combined Work.\r\n\r\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without\r\nbeing bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\r\n\r\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility\r\nrefers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the\r\nfacility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then\r\nyou may convey a copy of the modified version:\r\n\r\n    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure\r\n    that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the\r\n    facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains\r\n    meaningful, or\r\n    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this\r\n    License applicable to that copy.\r\n\r\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\r\n\r\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header\r\nfile that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms\r\nof your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to\r\nnumerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,\r\ninline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library\r\n       is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\r\n    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\r\n       document.\r\n\r\n4. Combined Works.\r\n\r\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,\r\neffectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library\r\ncontained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such\r\nmodifications, if you also do each of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the\r\n       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\n       this License.\r\n    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\r\n       document.\r\n    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,\r\n       include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well\r\n       as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this\r\n       license document.\r\n    d) Do one of the following:\r\n        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\r\n           License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable f\r\n           or, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the\r\n           Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce\r\n           a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of\r\n           the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\r\n        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.\r\n           A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the\r\n           Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will\r\n           operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is\r\n           interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\r\n    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be\r\n       required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and\r\n       only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and\r\n       execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining\r\n       or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked\r\n       Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must\r\n       accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\r\n       Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\r\n       Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for\r\n       conveying Corresponding Source.)\r\n\r\n5. Combined Libraries.\r\n\r\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by\r\nside in a single library together with other library facilities that are not\r\nApplications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined\r\nlibrary under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\r\n       Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under\r\n       the terms of this License.\r\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a\r\n       work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying\r\n       uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the GNU\r\nLesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\r\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\r\nnew problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you\r\nreceived it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of\r\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any\r\nlater version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\r\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\nLicense, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License\r\never published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether\r\nfuture versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that\r\nproxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization\r\nfor you to choose that version for the Library","risk":2,"spdx":"LGPL-3.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"ae912036-22a4-46ca-9ae6-4c4919ff8716"}
