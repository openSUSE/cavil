For \r\nexample, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification \r\ncould indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\r\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\r\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\nNon-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any \r\nstatutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such \r\nroyalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\r\nWaivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory \r\nor compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for \r\nany exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\r\nVoluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event \r\nthat the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, \r\nfrom any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights \r\ninclude the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and \r\nformats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\nYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or \r\nthe Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. \r\nYou may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient \r\nof the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense \r\nthe Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every \r\ncopy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose \r\nany effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise \r\nthe rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated \r\nin a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms \r\nof this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove \r\nfrom the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from \r\nany Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), \r\nas requested.\r\nYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version \r\nof this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either \r\nthis or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike \r\n3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned \r\nin (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the \r\nlicenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable \r\nLicense generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License \r\nwith every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on \r\nthe Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to \r\nexercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact \r\nall notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as \r\nincluded in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, \r\nYou may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of \r\nthe Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. \r\nThis Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection \r\napart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\r\nIf You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been \r\nmade pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium \r\nor means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or if \r\nthe Original Author and\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, \r\njournal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable \r\nmeans, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, \r\nthe URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright \r\nnotice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, \r\na credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\r\n\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented \r\nin any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit \r\nwill appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these \r\ncredits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of \r\ndoubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above \r\nand, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection \r\nwith, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You \r\nor Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and\/or \r\nAttribution Parties.\r\nExcept as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, \r\nDistribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not \r\ndistort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the \r\nOriginal Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise \r\nof the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, \r\nmutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor \r\nwill waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, \r\nto enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not \r\notherwise.\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS \r\nOR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, \r\nWARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR \r\nOTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT \r\nALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO \r\nYOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS \r\nLICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this \r\nLicense. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, \r\nwill not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. \r\nSections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\nSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable \r\ncopyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license \r\nterms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw \r\nthis License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and \r\nthis License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license \r\nto the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original \r\nWork on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity \r\nor enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, \r\nsuch provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent \r\nshall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\nThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are \r\nno understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be \r\nbound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without \r\nthe mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\nThe rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology \r\nof the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome \r\nConvention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal \r\nCopyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction \r\nin which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation \r\nof those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable \r\ncopyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included \r\nin the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law","risk":3,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"a997ad4c-7176-4e66-a2dc-4203b6d6b792"}
