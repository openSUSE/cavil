By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n<\/p>\n<p> This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n<\/p>\n<p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n<\/p>\n<p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it","risk":1,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"5997d090-fd23-4e36-b9f8-cf30b19aba79"}
