Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, \n\t\tor distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your \n\t\trights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or \n\t\trights, from you under this License will not have their licenses \n\t\tterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. <\/p>\n\t\t<p><strong>9.<\/strong> You are not required to accept this License, \n\t\tsince you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you \n\t\tpermission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. \n\t\tThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. \n\t\tTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based \n\t\ton the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, \n\t\tand all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying \n\t\tthe Library or works based on it. <\/p>\n\t\t<p><strong>10.<\/strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any \n\t\twork based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a \n\t\tlicense from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or \n\t\tmodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not \n\t\timpose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the \n\t\trights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance \n\t\tby third parties with this License. <\/p>\n\t\t<p><strong>11.<\/strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or \n\t\tallegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited \n\t\tto patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court \n\t\torder, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this \n\t\tLicense, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If \n\t\tyou cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations \n\t\tunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a \n\t\tconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a \n\t\tpatent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the \n\t\tLibrary by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through \n\t\tyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would \n\t\tbe to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. <\/p>\n\t\t<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under \n\t\tany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to \n\t\tapply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other \n\t\tcircumstances. <\/p>\n\t\t<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any \n\t\tpatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any \n\t\tsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the \n\t\tintegrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented \n\t\tby public license practices. Many people have made generous \n\t\tcontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that \n\t\tsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to \n\t\tthe author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute \n\t\tsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that \n\t\tchoice. <\/p>\n\t\t<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to \n\t\tbe a consequence of the rest of this License. <\/p>\n\t\t<p><strong>12.<\/strong> If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is \n\t\trestricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted \n\t\tinterfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under \n\t\tthis License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation \n\t\texcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or \n\t\tamong countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License \n\t\tincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p><strong>13.<\/strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised \n\t\tand\/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to \n\t\ttime. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present \n\t\tversion, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library \n\t\tspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any \n\t\tlater version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and \n\t\tconditions either of that version or of any later version published by \n\t\tthe Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license \n\t\tversion number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free \n\t\tSoftware Foundation. <\/p>\n\t\t<p><strong>14.<\/strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library \n\t\tinto other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible \n\t\twith these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software \n\t\twhich is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free \n\t\tSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision \n\t\twill be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all \n\t\tderivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse \n\t\tof software generally. <\/p>\n\t\t<p><strong>NO WARRANTY<\/strong> <\/p>\n\t\t<p><strong>15.<\/strong> BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, \n\t\tTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY \n\t\tAPPLICABLE LAW.
