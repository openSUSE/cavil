SIL makes its services available to all without regard to religious belief, political ideology, gender, race, or ethnic background. SIL's members and volunteers share a Christian commitment.\n\n6.2  What does this have to do with font licensing?\nThe ability to read, write, type and publish in one's own language is one of the most critical needs for millions of people around the world. This requires fonts that are widely available and support lesser-known languages. SIL develops - and encourages others to develop - a complete stack of writing systems implementation components available under open licenses. This open stack includes input methods, smart fonts, smart rendering libraries and smart applications. There has been a need for a common open license that is specifically applicable to fonts and related software (a crucial component of this stack) so SIL developed the SIL Open Font License with the help of the FLOSS community.\n\n6.3  How can I contact SIL?\nOur main web site is: http:\/\/www.sil.org\/\nOur site about complex scripts is: http:\/\/scripts.sil.org\/\nInformation about this license (including contact email information) is at: http:\/\/scripts.sil.org\/OFL\n\n\n7  ABOUT USING THE OFL FOR YOUR ORIGINAL FONTS\n\nIf you want to release your fonts under the OFL, you only need to do the following:\n\n7.1  Put your copyright and reserved font names information in the beginning of the main OFL file.\n7.2  Put your copyright and the OFL references in your various font files (such as in the copyright, license and description fields) and in your other components (build scripts, glyph databases, documentation, rendering samples, etc).\n7.3  Write an initial FONTLOG for your font and include it in the release package.\n7.4  Include the OFL in your release package.\n7.5  We also highly recommend you include the relevant practical documentation on the license by putting the OFL-FAQ in your package","risk":3,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"5551dfb6-0d47-425e-b265-48500a6c22a9"}
