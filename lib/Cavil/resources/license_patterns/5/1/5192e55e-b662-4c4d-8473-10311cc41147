Distribution Obligations.\n\n    3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\n    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make\n    available in Executable form must also be made available in Source\n    Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under\n    the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this\n    License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered\n    Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must\n    inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form\n    as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code\n    form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n    used for software exchange.\n\n    3.2. Modifications.\n\n    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License.

Required Notices.\n\n    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that\n    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.

Application of Additional Terms.\n\n    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in\n    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version\n    of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may\n    choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of\n    Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,\n    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\n    You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You\n    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\n    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability terms You offer.\n\n    3.5.

If You distribute the\n    Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You\n    must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from\n    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n    Developer or Contributor.

New Versions.\n\n    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may\n    publish revised and\/or new versions of this License from time to\n    time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n    Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license\n    steward has the right to modify this License.\n\n    4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\n    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\n    License under which You originally received the Covered Software.\n    If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original\n    Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made\n    available under any subsequent version of the License, You must\n    distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms\n    of the version of the License under which You originally received\n    the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,\n    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under\n    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n    the license steward.\n\n    4.3. Modified Versions.\n\n    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new\n    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a\n    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license\n    and remove any references to the name of the license steward\n    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and\n    (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which\n    differ from this License.\n\n5.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n    PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY\n    COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE\n    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY\n    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n    WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF\n    ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n    DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.\n    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond\n    the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a\n    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\n    assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that\n    the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where\n    the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where\n    the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if\n    the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors\n    under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days\n    notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically\n    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within\n    such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n    Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally\n    or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,\n    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any\n    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses\n    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n    LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n    STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF\n    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n    INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n    NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\n    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\n    APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is\n    defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial\n    computer software\" (as that term is defined at 48\n    C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software\n    documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n    (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those\n    rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in\n    lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or\n    provision that addresses Government rights in computer software\n    under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be governed\n    by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained\n    within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,\n    if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's\n    conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this\n    License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located\n    in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained\n    within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible\n    for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and\n    reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the\n    United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale\n    of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which\n    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed\n    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You agree\n    that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n    States export administration regulations (and the export control\n    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\n    distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing\n    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n    of liability.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND\nDISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\n\nFor Covered Software in this distribution, this License shall\nbe governed by the laws of Germany (excluding conflict-of-law\nprovisions).\n\nAny litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the\njurisdiction and the courts of Berlin Germany, with venue lying\nin Berlin Germany","risk":4,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"5192e55e-b662-4c4d-8473-10311cc41147"}
