Each such\n      runtime system is called a <em>node<\/em>. Message passing between\n      processes at different nodes, as well as links and monitors, are\n      transparent when pids are used. Registered names, however, are\n      local to each node. This means the node must be specified as well\n      when sending messages etc. using registered names.<\/p>\n    <p>The distribution mechanism is implemented using TCP\/IP sockets.\n      How to implement an alternative carrier is described in <em>ERTS User's Guide<\/em>.<\/p>\n  <\/section","risk":3,"spdx":"ErlPL-1.1","trademark":0,"unique_id":"58c07dce-f989-4377-bd5e-d56e03a46103"}
