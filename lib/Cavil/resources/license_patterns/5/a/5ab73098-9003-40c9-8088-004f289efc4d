Secondarily, this Licence preserves for the author and publisher a way to \r\nget credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.<\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para>This Licence is a kind of <quote>copyleft<\/quote>, which means that derivative works of the document must \r\nthemselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public Licence, which is a copyleft licence designed \r\nfor free software.<\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para>We have designed this Licence in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs \r\nfree documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But \r\nthis Licence is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or \r\nwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this Licence principally for works whose purpose is instruction \r\nor reference.<\/para>\r\n  <\/sect1>\r\n  <sect1 id=\"fdl-section1\">\r\n    <title>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<\/title>\r\n    <para id=\"fdl-document\">This Licence applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright \r\nholder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this Licence. The <quote>Document<\/quote>, below, refers to any \r\nsuch manual or work. Any member of the public is a licencee, and is addressed as <quote>you<\/quote>.<\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para id=\"fdl-modified\">A <quote>Modified Version<\/quote> of the Document means any work containing the Document \r\nor a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.<\/para>\r\n\t\r\n    <para id=\"fdl-secondary\">A <quote>Secondary Section<\/quote> is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the \r\n<link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors \r\nof the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly \r\nwithin that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section \r\nmay not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with \r\nrelated matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.<\/para>\r\n\r\n    <para id=\"fdl-invariant\">The <quote>Invariant Sections<\/quote> are certain <link linkend=\"fdl-secondary\"> Secondary \r\nSections<\/link> whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the \r\n<link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> is released under this Licence.<\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para id=\"fdl-cover-texts\">The <quote>Cover Texts<\/quote> are certain short passages of text that are listed, as \r\nFront-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the <link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> \r\nis released under this Licence.<\/para>\r\n\t\r\n    <para id=\"fdl-transparent\">A <quote>Transparent<\/quote> copy of the <link linkend=\"fdl-document\"> Document<\/link> \r\nmeans a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose \r\ncontents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of \r\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input \r\nto text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy \r\nmade in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification \r\nby readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not <quote>Transparent<\/quote> is called <quote>Opaque<\/quote>.<\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, \r\nLaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human \r\nmodification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary \r\nword processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated \r\nHTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.<\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para id=\"fdl-title-page\">The <quote>Title Page<\/quote> means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such \r\nfollowing pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this Licence requires to appear in the title page.

Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The \r\nfront cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other \r\nmaterial on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of \r\nthe <link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in \r\nother respects.<\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed \r\n(as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.<\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para>If you publish or distribute <link linkend=\"fdl-transparent\">Opaque<\/link> copies of the <link linkend=\"fdl-document\r\n\">Document<\/link> numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable <link linkend=\"fdl-transparent\r\n\">Transparent<\/link> copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network \r\nlocation containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using \r\npublic has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter \r\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure \r\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last \r\ntime you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.<\/para>\r\n    \r\n    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the <link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> \r\nwell before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version \r\nof the Document.<\/para>\r\n    <\/sect1>\r\n    \r\n  <sect1 id=\"fdl-section4\">\r\n    <title>4.
