{"license":"LGPL-2.0+","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"License\r\n\r\n$SKIP3 are released under LGPL.\r\n\r\nGNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n   0.\r\n\r\n      This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\r\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other\r\nauthorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this\r\nLesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee\r\nis addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\n      A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\r\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which\r\nuse some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\n      The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\r\nwhich has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the\r\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright\r\nlaw: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated straightforwardly\r\ninto another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\r\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n      \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all\r\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\r\nand installation of the library.\r\n\r\n      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\r\nnot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\r\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\r\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on\r\nthe Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing\r\nit). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the\r\nprogram that uses the Library does.\r\n   1.\r\n\r\n      You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\r\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\r\nthat refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and\r\ndistribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\n      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\r\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\r\nfee.\r\n   2.\r\n\r\n      You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of\r\nit, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute\r\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\r\nthat you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n         1. The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n         2. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\r\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n         3. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\ncharge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n         4. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or\r\na table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the\r\nfacility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,\r\nthen you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an\r\napplication does not supply such function or table, the facility still\r\noperates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n\r\n      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a\r\npurpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.\r\nTherefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function\r\nor table used by this function must be optional: if the application does\r\nnot supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\n      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and\r\ncan be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\r\nthe Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\r\nLicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\r\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\n      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\r\ncontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent\r\nis to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\n      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\r\nLibrary with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a\r\nvolume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work\r\nunder the scope of this License.\r\n   3.\r\n\r\n      You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do\r\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that\r\nthey refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead\r\nof to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary\r\nGNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that\r\nversion instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these\r\nnotices.\r\n\r\n      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\r\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\n      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the\r\nLibrary into a program that is not a library.\r\n   4.\r\n\r\n      You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative\r\nof it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\r\nof Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the\r\ncomplete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\r\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\r\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute\r\nthe source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the\r\nsource along with the object code.\r\n   5.\r\n\r\n      A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\r\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in\r\nisolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls\r\noutside the scope of this License.\r\n      However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\r\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\r\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\r\nlibrary\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6\r\nstates terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\n      When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header\r\nfile that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked\r\nwithout the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold\r\nfor this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\n      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\r\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file\r\nis unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.\r\n(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library\r\nwill still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\n      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any\r\nexecutables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or\r\nnot they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n   6.\r\n\r\n      As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link\r\na \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work\r\ncontaining portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms\r\nof your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work\r\nfor the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such\r\nmodifications.\r\n\r\n      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\nthis License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during\r\nexecution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright\r\nnotice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the\r\nuser to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n         1. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\nmachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes\r\nwere used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2\r\nabove); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with\r\nthe complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object\r\ncode and\/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then\r\nrelink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.\r\n(It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions\r\nfiles in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the\r\napplication to use the modified definitions.) .\r\n         2. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\nLibrary. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of\r\nthe library already present on the user's computer system, rather than\r\ncopying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate\r\nproperly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs\r\none, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the\r\nversion that the work was made with.\r\n         3. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\r\nthree years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection\r\n6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this\r\ndistribution.\r\n         4. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to\r\ncopy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\r\nspecified materials from the same place.\r\n         5. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\nmaterials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n\r\n      For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\r\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\r\nreproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the\r\nmaterials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally\r\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components\r\n(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the\r\nexecutable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\n      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\naccompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use\r\nboth them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\r\n   7.\r\n\r\n      You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\r\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\r\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the\r\nLibrary and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and\r\nprovided that you do these two things:\r\n         1.\r\n\r\n            Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\r\nbased on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This\r\nmust be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\n         2.\r\n\r\n            Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\r\nthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to\r\nfind the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n   8.\r\n\r\n      You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\r\nLibrary except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\r\nLibrary is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\r\nLicense. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you\r\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as\r\nsuch parties remain in full compliance.\r\n   9.\r\n\r\n      You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library),\r\nyou indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms\r\nand conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or\r\nworks based on it.\r\n  10.\r\n\r\n      Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\nsubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\r\nthis License.\r\n  11.\r\n\r\n      If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\r\nso as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\r\nany other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\r\ndistribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not\r\npermit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who\r\nreceive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\r\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\r\ndistribution of the Library.\r\n\r\n      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\r\nunder any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended\r\nto apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such\r\nclaims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of\r\nthe free software distribution system which is implemented by public\r\nlicense practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the\r\nwide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\r\nconsistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to\r\ndecide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other\r\nsystem and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\n      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed\r\nto be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n  12.\r\n\r\n      If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may\r\nadd an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\r\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\r\nnot thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation\r\nas if written in the body of this License.\r\n  13.\r\n\r\n      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\r\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\r\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ\r\nin detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\r\nLibrary specifies a version number of this License which applies to it\r\nand \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license\r\nversion number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.\r\n  14.\r\n\r\n      If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write\r\nto the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\r\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\r\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\r\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNo Warranty\r\n\r\n  15.\r\n\r\n      Because the library is licensed free of charge, there is no\r\nwarranty for the library, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\r\nExcept when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and\/or\r\nother parties provide the library \"as is\" without warranty of any kind,\r\neither expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied\r\nwarranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The\r\nentire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you.\r\nShould the library prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary\r\nservicing, repair or correction.\r\n  16.\r\n\r\n      In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in\r\nwriting will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify\r\nand\/or redistribute the library as permitted above, be liable to you for\r\ndamages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential\r\ndamages arising out of the use or inability to use the library (including\r\nbut not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or\r\nlosses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to\r\noperate with any other software), even if such holder or other party has\r\nbeen advised of the possibility of such damages","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"53209051-1347-406e-87da-1c0221359cb1"}
