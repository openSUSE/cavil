By contrast, the \r\nGNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software\\'97to make sure the \r\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\\'92s \r\nsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is \r\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\\\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to \r\nmake sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), \r\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new \r\nfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.\\\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender \r\nthe rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, \r\nor if you modify it.\\\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all \r\nthe rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them \r\nthese terms so they know their rights.\\\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal \r\npermission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\\\r\nAlso, for each author\\'92s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty \r\nfor this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that \r\nwhat they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\\'92 \r\nreputations.\\\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors \r\nof a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, \r\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\\'92s free use or not licensed at all.\\\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\ri0\\qc\r\n\r\n\\fs31 \\cf0 Terms and Conditions For Copying, Distribution and Modification\r\n\\fs24  \\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 1.\tThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying \r\nit may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \\'93Program\\'94, below, refers to any such \r\nprogram or work, and a \\'93work based on the Program\\'94 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright \r\nlaw: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or \r\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \\'93modification\\'94.) \r\nEach licensee is addressed as \\'93you\\'94.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\ri0\\qj\r\n\\cf0 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside \r\nits scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its \r\ncontents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that \r\nis true depends on what the Program does.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 2.\tYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\\'92s source code as you receive it, in any medium, \r\nprovided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer \r\nof warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any \r\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\ri0\\qj\r\n\\cf0 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection \r\nin exchange for a fee.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 3.\tYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, \r\nand copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all \r\nof these conditions:\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li1200\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 (a)\tYou must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date \r\nof any change.\\\r\n(b)\tYou must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the \r\nProgram or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\\\r\n(c)\tIf the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running \r\nfor such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright \r\nnotice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute \r\nthe program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program \r\nitself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required \r\nto print an announcement.)\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\ri0\\sb100\\qj\r\n\\cf0 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived \r\nfrom the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, \r\nand its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the \r\nsame sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the \r\nterms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every \r\npart regardless of who wrote it.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\qj\r\n\\cf0 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;\r\n rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on \r\nthe Program.\\\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the \r\nProgram) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 4.\tYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable \r\nform under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li1200\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 (a)\tAccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under \r\nthe terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\\\r\n(b)\tAccompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more \r\nthan your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source \r\ncode, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\r\n or,\\\r\n(c)\tAccompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative \r\nis allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form \r\nwith such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\ri0\\sb100\\qj\r\n\\cf0 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable \r\nwork, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition \r\nfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, \r\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) \r\nwith the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless \r\nthat component itself accompanies the executable.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\qj\r\n\\cf0 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering \r\nequivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though \r\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 5.\tYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. \r\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate \r\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will \r\nnot have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\\\r\n6.\tYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission \r\nto modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept \r\nthis License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your \r\nacceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program \r\nor works based on it.\\\r\n7.\tEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a \r\nlicense from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. \r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\\'92 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not \r\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\\\r\n8.\tIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited \r\nto patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the \r\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so \r\nas to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence \r\nyou may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution \r\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy \r\nboth it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\ri0\\qj\r\n\\cf0 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance \r\nof the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\\\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest \r\nvalidity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution \r\nsystem, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range \r\nof software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor \r\nto decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that \r\nchoice.\\\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 9.\tIf the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted \r\ninterfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical \r\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not \r\nthus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\\\r\n10.\tThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the General Public License from time to \r\ntime. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems \r\nor concerns.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\ri0\\qj\r\n\\cf0 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License \r\nwhich applies to it and \\'93any later version\\'94, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either \r\nof that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a \r\nversion number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 11.\tIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are \r\ndifferent, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, \r\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two \r\ngoals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of \r\nsoftware generally.\\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\ri0\\qc\r\n\r\n\\fs31 \\cf0 No Warranty \r\n\\fs24  \\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\li600\\fi-300\\ri0\\sb50\\qj\r\n\\cf0 12.\tBecause the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted \r\nby applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and\/or other parties provide the program \r\n\\'93as is\\'94 without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied \r\nwarranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance \r\nof the program is with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair \r\nor correction.\r\n\\f0 \\\r\n\r\n\\f1 13.\tIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other \r\nparty who may modify and\/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any \r\ngeneral, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program (including \r\nbut not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure \r\nof the program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility \r\nof such damages.\r\n\\f0 \\\r\n\\pard\\pardeftab720\\ri0\\sb100\\qc\r\n\r\n\\f1\\fs31 \\cf0 End of Terms and Conditions\r\n\\fs24","risk":3,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"5c44c801-1ecc-490a-b415-3ffa98a090c8"}
