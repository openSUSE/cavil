The Lesser\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the library. <\/p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLicense because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor many libraries.

To achieve this, non-free programs must\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody of free software.
