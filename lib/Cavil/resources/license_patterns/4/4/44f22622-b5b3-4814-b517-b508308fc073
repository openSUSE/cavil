{"export_restricted":0,"license":"LGPL-2.1+","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n     Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special\n     exception, the materials to be distributed need not include\n     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of\n     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that\n     component itself accompanies the executable.\n\n     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you\n     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable\n     that you distribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other\n     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\n     such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution\n     of the work based on the Library and of the other library\n     facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these\n     two things:\n\n       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n          Sections above.\n\n       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n          where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same\n          work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\n     Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate\n     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have\n     received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not\n     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n     full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify\n     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions\n     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\n     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work\n     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this\n     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\n     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the\n     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose\n     any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\n     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\n     by third parties with this License.\n\n 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent\n     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\n     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\n     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\n     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\n     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\n     Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit\n     royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who\n     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only\n     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\n     entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\n     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is\n     intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply\n     in other circumstances.\n\n     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of\n     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\n     the integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n     system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is\n     willing to distribute software through any other system and a\n     licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed\n     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n 12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\n     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\n     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this\n     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\n     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\n     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this\n     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\n     this License.\n\n 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n     versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies\n     to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following\n     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\n     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library\n     does not specify a license version number, you may choose any\n     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n     write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\n     status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\n     the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                                NO WARRANTY\n\n 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\n     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n     HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\n     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\n     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\n     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n     LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY\n     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\n     MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\n     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\n     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n     INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\n     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY\n     OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n---------------------------\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of\nthe ordinary General Public License).\n\n   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have\nat least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is\nfound.\n\n     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE LIBRARY'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.\n     Copyright (C) YEAR  NAME OF AUTHOR\n\n     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n     under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at\n     your option) any later version.\n\n     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n     Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,\n     USA.\n\n   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper\nmail.\n\n   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library\n     `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\n     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1990","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"44f22622-b5b3-4814-b517-b508308fc073"}
