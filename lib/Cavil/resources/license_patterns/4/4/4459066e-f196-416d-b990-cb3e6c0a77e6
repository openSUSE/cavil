From time\r\nto time The Qt Company may change support provided within each Support plan;\r\nprovided that during the respective Initial Support Term or Support Renewal Term\r\n(as the case may be), the level of support provided by The Qt Company may not be\r\nreduced without the consent of the Licensee.\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise agreed, The Qt Company shall not be responsible for providing\r\nany service or support to the Customers.\r\n\r\n9. CONFIDENTIALITY\r\n\r\nEach Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may\r\nreceive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business\r\nplans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information,\r\nincluding the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value\r\nto the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if\r\ndisclosed to third parties (\"Confidential Information\"). Accordingly, when a\r\nParty (the \"Receiving Party\") receives Confidential Information from the other\r\nParty (the \"Disclosing Party\"), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such\r\ninformation to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall\r\ncause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all\r\nConfidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential\r\nInformation to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written\r\napproval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential\r\nInformation for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling\r\nits responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take\r\nreasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party,\r\nwhich measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to\r\nprotect its own confidential and proprietary information.\r\n\r\nObligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or\r\nbecomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the\r\nReceiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to\r\nthe disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or\r\nuse; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the\r\nReceiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not\r\nhad access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by\r\nthe written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the\r\nReceiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation\r\nof confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose,\r\nin which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such\r\ncompelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the\r\ninformation and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of\r\ndisclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the\r\nminimum extent necessary.\r\n\r\nThe obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a\r\nperiod of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade\r\nsecrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade\r\nsecret laws.\r\n\r\n10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT\r\n\r\n10.1 License Fees\r\n\r\nLicense Fees are described in The Qt Company's standard price list, quote or\r\nPurchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be. The\r\nLicense Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit, even on the ground\r\nthat Distribution Licenses are not used, i.e. Redistributables are not actually\r\ndistributed corresponding to the Distribution Licenses purchased, or for any\r\nother reason.\r\n\r\n10.2 Ordering Licenses\r\n\r\nLicensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant to\r\nagreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon, at\r\nThe Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.\r\nLicensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and\r\nDistribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable\r\nto The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a \"Purchase Order\")\r\nfor confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the\r\nParties.\r\n\r\n10.3 Distribution License Packs\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise agreed, the Distribution Licenses are bought by way of\r\nDistribution License Packs. Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License\r\nPack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available\r\nfor installing, bundling or integrating (all jointly \"installing\") the\r\nRedistributables with the Devices or for otherwise distributing the\r\nRedistributables in accordance with this Agreement. Each time Licensee\r\n\"installs\" or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution\r\nLicense is used, and Licensee's account of available Distribution Licenses is\r\ndecreased accordingly. Licensee may \"install\" copies of the Redistributables so\r\nlong as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.\r\nRedistributables will be deemed to have been \"installed\" into a Device when one\r\nof the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables have\r\nbeen loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee's premises or b)\r\nthe Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory (or sold)\r\nfor the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use (or pay for) more\r\nthan one Distribution License for each individual Device, e.g. in a situation\r\nwhere a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after delivery to a\r\ndistributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee includes a back-up\r\ncopy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage medium along with the\r\nproduct, that backup copy of the Redistributables will not be deemed to have\r\nbeen \"installed\" and will not require an additional Distribution License.\r\n\r\n10.4 Payment Terms\r\n\r\nLicense Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by\r\nLicensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice\r\nfrom The Qt Company.
