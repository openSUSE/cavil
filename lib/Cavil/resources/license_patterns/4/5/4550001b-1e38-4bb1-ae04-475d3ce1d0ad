For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\n@item\nVERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n@item\nCOPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\nand the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\nthe copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\nTransparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\ngeneral network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\ncharge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\nTransparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\nuntil at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\ncopy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\nthe public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n@item\nMODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n@enumerate A\n@item\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\nfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\nof the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\nif the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n@item\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\nresponsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\nVersion, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\nDocument (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).\n\n@item\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\nModified Version, as the publisher.\n\n@item\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n@item\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\nadjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n@item\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\ngiving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\nterms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n@item\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\nand required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\n\n@item\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n@item\nPreserve the section entitled ``History'', and its title, and add to\nit an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\npublisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\nthere is no section entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one\nstating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\ngiven on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\nVersion as stated in the previous sentence.\n\n@item\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\npublic access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\nthe network locations given in the Document for previous versions\nit was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.\nYou may omit a network location for a work that was published at\nleast four years before the Document itself, or if the original\npublisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n\n@item\nIn any section entitled ``Acknowledgments'' or ``Dedications'',\npreserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the\nsubstance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments\nand\/or dedications given therein.\n\n@item\nPreserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\nunaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\nor the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n\n@item\nDelete any section entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section\nmay not be included in the Modified Version","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"4550001b-1e38-4bb1-ae04-475d3ce1d0ad"}
