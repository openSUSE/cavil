{"license":"any proprietary","opinion":0,"packname":"xv","patent":0,"pattern":"the heading of 'personal use'.  If you are a sysadmin, you can put XV\nup in a public directory for your users amusement.  Again, 'personal\nuse', albeit plural.\n\nOn the other hand, if you use XV in the course of doing your work,\nwhatever your 'work' may happen to be, you *must* register your\ncopy of XV.  (Note:  If you are a student, and you use XV to do \nclasswork or research, you should get your professor\/teacher\/advisor\nto purchase an appropriate number of copies.)\n\nXV licenses are $25 each.  You should purchase one license per\nworkstation, or one per XV user, whichever is the smaller number.  XV\nis *not* sold on a 'number of concurrent users' basis.  If XV was some\n$1000 program, yes, that would be a reasonable request, but at $25,\nit's not.  Also, given that XV is completely unlocked, there is no way\nto enforce any 'number of concurrent users' limits, so it isn't sold\nthat way.\n\nPrinted and bound copies of the 100-odd page XV manual are available\nfor $15 each.  Note that manuals are *only* sold with, at minimum, an\nequal number of licenses.  (e.g.  if you purchase 5 licenses, you can\nalso purchase *up to* 5 copies of the manual)\n\nThe source code to the program can be had (as a compressed 'tar' file\nsplit over a couple 3.5\" MS-DOS formatted floppies) for $15, for those\nwho don't have ftp capabilities.\n\nOrders outside the US and Canada must add an additional $5 per manual\nordered to cover the additional shipping charges.\n\nChecks, money orders, and purchase orders are accepted.  Credit cards\nare not.  All forms of payment must be payable in US Funds.  Checks\nmust be payable through a US bank (or a US branch of a non-US bank).\nPurchase orders for less than $50, while still accepted, are not\nencouraged. \n\nAll payments should be payable to 'John Bradley', and mailed to:\n        John Bradley\n        1053 Floyd Terrace\n        Bryn Mawr, PA  19010\n        USA\n\n\nSite Licenses\n-------------\nIf you are planning to purchase 10 or more licenses, site licenses are\navailable, at a substantial discount.  Site licenses let you run XV on\nany and all computing equipment at the site, for any purpose\nwhatsoever.  The site license covers the current version of XV, and\nany versions released within one year of the licensing date.  You are\nalso allowed to duplicate and distribute an unlimited number of copies\nof the XV manual, but only for use within the site.  Covered versions\nof the software may be run in perpetuity.\n\nAlso, it should be noted that a 'site' can be defined as anything\nyou'd like.  It can be a physical location (a room, building,\nlocation, etc.), an organizational grouping (a workgroup, department,\ndivision, etc.) or any other logical grouping (\"the seventeen\ntechnical writers scattered about our company\", etc.).\n\nThe site license cost will be based on your estimate of the number of\nXV users or workstations at your site, whichever is the smaller\nnumber.\n\nIf you are interested in obtaining a site license, please contact the\nauthor via electronic mail or FAX (see below for details).  Send\ninformation regarding your site (the name or definition of the 'site',\na physical address, a fax number, and an estimate of the number of\nusers or workstations), and we'll get a site license out to you for\nyour examination.\n\n\nCopyright Notice\n----------------\nXV is Copyright 1989, 1994 by John Bradley\n\nPermission to copy and distribute XV in its entirety, for\nnon-commercial purposes, is hereby granted without fee, provided that\nthis license information and copyright notice appear in all copies.\n\nIf you redistribute XV, the *entire* contents of this distribution\nmust be distributed, including the README, and INSTALL files, the\nsources, and the complete contents of the 'docs' directory.\n\nNote that distributing XV 'bundled' in with any product is considered\nto be a 'commercial purpose'.\n\nAlso note that any copies of XV that are distributed MUST be built\nand\/or configured to be in their 'unregistered copy' mode, so that it\nis made obvious to the user that XV is shareware, and that they should\nconsider registering, or at least reading this information.\n\nThe software may be modified for your own purposes, but modified\nversions may not be distributed without prior consent of the author.\n\nThis software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied\nwarranty.
