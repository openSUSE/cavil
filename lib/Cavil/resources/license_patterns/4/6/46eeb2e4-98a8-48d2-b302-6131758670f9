Since shortly before his\npassing in 2012, Michael Droettboom has been the lead maintainer of\nmatplotlib, but, as has always been the case, matplotlib is the work\nof many.\n\nPrior to July of 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, the copyright of the\nsource code was held by John Hunter.  As of July 2013, and the 1.3.0\nrelease, matplotlib has moved to a shared copyright model.\n\nmatplotlib uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains\ncopyright over their contributions to matplotlib. But, it is important to\nnote that these contributions are typically only changes to the\nrepositories. Thus, the matplotlib source code, in its entirety, is not\nthe copyright of any single person or institution.  Instead, it is the\ncollective copyright of the entire matplotlib Development Team.  If\nindividual contributors want to maintain a record of what\nchanges\/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should\nindicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when\nthey commit the change to one of the matplotlib repositories.\n\nThe Matplotlib Development Team is the set of all contributors to the\nmatplotlib project.  A full list can be obtained from the git version\ncontrol logs.\n\nLicense agreement for matplotlib |version|\n==============================================\n\n1.
