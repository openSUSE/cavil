By contrast, the GNU \r\nGeneral Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software - to make sure the software \r\nis free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and \r\nto any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by \r\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to \r\nmake sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), \r\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new \r\nfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender \r\nthe rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, \r\nor if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all \r\nthe rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show \r\nthem these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal \r\npermission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty \r\nfor this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that \r\nwhat they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' \r\nreputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors \r\nof a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, \r\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"GPL2_SEC3\"> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n- This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it \r\nmay be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program \r\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that \r\nis to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated \r\ninto another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee \r\nis addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\n Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its \r\nscope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents \r\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true \r\ndepends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided \r\nthat you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\r\n keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients \r\nof the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection \r\nin exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, \r\nand copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all \r\nof these conditions:\r\n\r\n -# You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of \r\nany change.\r\n\r\n -# You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the \r\nProgram or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n -# If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running \r\nfor such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright \r\nnotice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute \r\nthe program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program \r\nitself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required \r\nto print an announcement.)\r\n\r\n These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from \r\nthe Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its \r\nterms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same \r\nsections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms \r\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless \r\nof who wrote it","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"4af3c8e4-baa9-44b1-b738-41bc41c434d5"}
