Then, when copying the new files into your\r\nproject, add a brief note at the beginning of the files recording the\r\nauthors, the public domain status, and anything else relevant.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when merging some public domain code into an\r\nexisting file covered by the GPL (or LGPL or other free software\r\nlicense), there is no reason to indicate the pieces which are public\r\ndomain.  The notice saying that the whole file is under the GPL (or\r\nother license) is legally sufficient.\r\n\r\nUsing code that is not in the public domain, but rather released under\r\na GPL-compatible free license, may require preserving copyright\r\n","risk":1,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"4a4110d9-554b-4826-a8f6-a351e6a114d4"}
