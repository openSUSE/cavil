That means it will be\r\nreleased under two different licenses: in the manual under the GFDL,\r\nand in the code example file under a software license.\r\n\r\nIf the example is important and nontrivial, and 40 lines or more, we\r\nsuggest releasing the code copy under the same license as the program\r\nit pertains to.  Otherwise, we recommend releasing it under the X11 license.\r\n\r\n@node License Notices for Other Files\r\n@subsection License Notices for Other Files\r\n\r\nSmall supporting files, short manuals (under 300 lines long) and rough\r\ndocumentation (@file{README} files, @file{INSTALL} files, etc.)@: can\r\nuse a simple all-permissive license like this one:\r\n\r\n@smallexample\r\nCopying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,\r\nare permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright\r\nnotice and this notice are preserved.
