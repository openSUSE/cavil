{"license":"GFDL-1.3","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices\nthat qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the\nDocument, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections\nas invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant\nSections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles\nmust be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it\ncontains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties --- for example, statements of peer review or that the text\nhas been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of\nCover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text\nand one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made\nby) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the\nsame cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same\nentity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may\nreplace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher\nthat added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\npermission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply\nendorsement of any Modified Version.\n@unnumberedsubsec  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,\nprovided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections\nof all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as\nInvariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that\nyou preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\nidentical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there\nare multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,\nmake the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in\nparentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section\nif known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section\ntitles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\ncombined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled\n``History'' in the various original documents, forming one\nsection Entitled ``History''; likewise combine any sections\nEntitled ``Acknowledgements'', and any sections Entitled\n``Dedications''. You must delete all sections Entitled\n``Endorsements''.\n@unnumberedsubsec  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other\nrespects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n@unnumberedsubsec  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\nindependent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of\nthe compilation's users beyond what the individual works\npermit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does\nnot apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies\nof the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire\naggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that\nbracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of\ncovers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear\non printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n@unnumberedsubsec  8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\ntranslations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\nInvariant Sections with translations requires special permission from\ntheir copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all\nInvariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant\nSections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the\nlicense notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided\nthat you also include the original English version of this License and the\noriginal versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a\ndisagreement between the translation and the original version of this\nLicense or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',\n``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement\n(section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require\nchanging the actual title.\n@unnumberedsubsec  9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this License.\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless\nand until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\nlicense, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you\nof the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the\ncessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\npermanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some\nreasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\nviolation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and\nyou cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this\nLicense. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not\ngive you any rights to use it.\n@unnumberedsubsec  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\nFree Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns. See\n@uref{http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/,Copyleft}.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If\nthe Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License\n``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of\nany later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free\nSoftware Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)\nby the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy\ncan decide which future versions of this License can be used, that\nproxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\nauthorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\n@unnumberedsubsec  11. RELICENSING\n\n``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site'' (or ``MMC\nSite'') means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable\nworks and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those\nworks. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a\nserver. A ``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration'' (or\n``MMC'') contained in the site means any set of copyrightable\nworks thus published on the MMC site.\n\n``CC-BY-SA'' means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike\n3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit\ncorporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published\nby that same organization.\n\n``Incorporate'' means to publish or republish a Document, in\nwhole or in part, as part of another Document.\n\nAn MMC is ``eligible for relicensing'' if it is licensed under\nthis License, and if all works that were first published under this\nLicense somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in\nwhole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant\nsections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\n\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site\nunder CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,\nprovided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n@unnumberedsubsec  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"0cf4b251-503b-4444-8c9d-f669952e81c1"}
