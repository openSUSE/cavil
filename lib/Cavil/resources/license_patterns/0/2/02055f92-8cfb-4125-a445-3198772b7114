PREAMBLE\n-----------\n\n   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure\neveryone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or\nwithout modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\nmodifications made by others.\n\n   This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\ndesigned for free software.\n\n   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free program\nshould come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software\ndoes.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be\nused for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is\npublished as a printed book.  We recommend this License principally for\nworks whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n--------------------------------\n\n   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below, refers\nto any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and\nis addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you copy, modify or\ndistribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\n   A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\n\n   A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section\nof the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\n   The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that\nsays that the Document is released under this License.  If a section\ndoes not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to\nbe designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero Invariant\nSections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then\nthere are none.\n\n   The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may be\nat most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\n   A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the general\npublic, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly\nwith generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic\npaint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,\nand that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic\ntranslation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text\nformatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose\nmarkup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage\nsubsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format\nis not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy\nthat is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.\n\n   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or\nXML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,\nPostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated\nHTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output\npurposes only.\n\n   The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats\nwhich do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text\nnear the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the\nbeginning of the body of the text.\n\n   The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of\nthe Document to the public.\n\n   A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,\n“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.\n\n   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice\nwhich states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,\nbut only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that\nthese Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the\nmeaning of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n-------------------\n\n   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to\nthe Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying\nof the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\n   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n----------------------\n\n   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:\nFront-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back\ncover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the\npublisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title\nwith all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add\nother material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited\nto the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and\nsatisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other\nrespects.\n\n   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\n   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\ncomputer-network location from which the general network-using public\nhas access to download using public-standard network protocols a\ncomplete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If\nyou use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when\nyou begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\nTransparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\nuntil at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\ncopy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\nthe public","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"02055f92-8cfb-4125-a445-3198772b7114"}
