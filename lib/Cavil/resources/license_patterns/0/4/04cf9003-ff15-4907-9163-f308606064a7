Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium\r\nbut is also freely distributable.\r\n\r\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\r\nTo avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading\r\nsupport has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified\r\nto produce \"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW\r\nalgorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable\r\nby all standard GIF decoders","risk":1,"spdx":"IJG","trademark":0,"unique_id":"04cf9003-ff15-4907-9163-f308606064a7"}
