And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n+the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n+permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n+\n+  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n+library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n+version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n+the original authors' reputations.\n+\f\n+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n+software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n+transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n+we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n+free use or not licensed at all.\n+\n+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n+GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n+license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n+designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n+one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n+the same as in the ordinary license.\n+\n+  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n+they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n+program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n+changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n+analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n+a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n+derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n+treats it as such.\n+\n+  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n+Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n+sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n+concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n+\n+  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n+users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n+libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n+permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n+preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n+libraries that are incorporated in them.
