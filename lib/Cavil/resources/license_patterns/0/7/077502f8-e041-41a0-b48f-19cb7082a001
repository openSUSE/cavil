(You will not be\n      required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but\n      only to the computing community at large as a market\n      that must bear the fee.)\n\n      \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for\n      the item itself, though there may be fees involved in\n      handling the item.
