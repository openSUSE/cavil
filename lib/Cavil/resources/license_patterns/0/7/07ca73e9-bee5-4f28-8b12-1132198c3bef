You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n      code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n      complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n      with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n      it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n      library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n      permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n      there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n      modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n      that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n      author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n      introduced by others.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n      any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n      effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n      restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n      any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n      consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n      ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n      General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n      is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n      this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n      libraries into non-free programs.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n      a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n      combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n      General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n      entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n      Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n      the library.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      We call this license the <quote>Lesser<\/quote> General Public License\n      because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary\n      General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers\n      Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These\n      disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License\n      for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in\n      certain special circumstances.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n      encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n      a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n      allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n      library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n      case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n      software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n      programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n      free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n      non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n      operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n      system.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n      users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n      linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n      that program using a modified version of the Library.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para>\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n      modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n      <quote>work based on the library<\/quote> and a <quote>work that uses the\n      library<\/quote>.  The former contains code derived from the library,\n      whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\n    <\/para>\n\n  <\/sect1>\n\n  <sect1 id=\"terms\" label=\"none\">\n    <title>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<\/title>\n\n    <sect2 id=\"sect0\" label=\"0\">\n      <title>Section 0<\/title>\n      <para>\n\tThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n\tprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n\tother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n\tthis Lesser General Public License (also called <quote>this License<\/quote>).\n\tEach licensee is addressed as <quote>you<\/quote>.\n      <\/para>\n\n      <para>\n\tA <quote>library<\/quote> means a collection of software functions and\/or data\n\tprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n\t(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n      <\/para>\n\n      <para>\n\tThe <quote>Library<\/quote>, below, refers to any such software library or work\n\twhich has been distributed under these terms.
