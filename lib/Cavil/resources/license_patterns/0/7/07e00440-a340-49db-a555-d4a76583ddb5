You must\r\n    include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\r\n    otherwise make available.

Application of Additional Terms.\r\n    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the\r\n    applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder.

If You distribute the\r\n    Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms\r\n    which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.

New Versions.\r\n    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and\/or new versions of this License\r\n    from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3,\r\n    no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\r\n\r\n    4.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of\r\n    the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer\r\n    includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under\r\n    any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms\r\n    of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also\r\n    choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version\r\n    of the License published by the license steward.\r\n\r\n    4.3. Modified Versions.\r\n    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create\r\n    and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name \r\nof\r\n    the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear \r\nthat\r\n    the license contains terms which differ from this License.\r\n\r\n5.

Provisions which, by their\r\n    nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\r\n    or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as\r\n    “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant\r\n    is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or\r\n    indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant,\r\n    the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1\r\n    and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically\r\n    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with\r\n    respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement\r\n    with Participant.\r\n\r\n    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly\r\n    or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\r\n    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant\r\n    under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\r\n    by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\r\n    shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n7.
