This reduces the number of false\npositives that Memcheck otherwise typically reports for MPI\napplications.<\/para>\n\n<para>The wrappers also take the opportunity to carefully check\nsize and definedness of buffers passed as arguments to MPI functions, hence\ndetecting errors such as passing undefined data to\n<computeroutput>PMPI_Send<\/computeroutput>, or receiving data into a\nbuffer which is too small.<\/para>\n\n<para>Unlike most of the rest of Valgrind, the wrapper library is subject to a\nBSD-style license, so you can link it into any code base you like.\nSee the top of <computeroutput>mpi\/libmpiwrap.c<\/computeroutput>\nfor license details.<\/para","risk":1,"spdx":"BSD-3-Clause","trademark":0,"unique_id":"fc03edb8-aa77-42ae-970d-e9f3c9d787fa"}
