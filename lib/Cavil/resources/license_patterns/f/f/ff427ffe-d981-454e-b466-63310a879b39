In other words:\r\n\r\n* Creating derivative software, e.g. a 'nanotoconf' project that uses\r\n  `make-it-quick` code, requires you to comply with the GPL, and in\r\n  particular to redistribute your code in source form. The fact that\r\n  it's really hard to distribute makefiles in binary form should help\r\n  you comply with this anyway :-)\r\n\r\n* Building software using `make-it-quick` does not make that software\r\n  GPL, any more than building it using GCC or GNU Make.
