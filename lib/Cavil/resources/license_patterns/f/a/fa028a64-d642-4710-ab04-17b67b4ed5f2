If the library is modified by someone else and \"\n  \"passed on, we\\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not t\"\n  \"he original\\nversion, so that any problems introduced by others will no\"\n  \"t reflect on\\nthe original authors\\' reputations.\\n\\014\\n  Finally, any\"\n  \" free program is threatened constantly by software\\npatents.  We wish t\"\n  \"o avoid the danger that companies distributing free\\nsoftware will indi\"\n  \"vidually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\\ntransforming the progr\"\n  \"am into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\\nwe have made it clear \"\n  \"that any patent must be licensed for everyone\\'s\\nfree use or not licen\"\n  \"sed at all.\\n\\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covere\"\n  \"d by the ordinary\\nGNU General Public License, which was designed for u\"\n  \"tility programs.  This\\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License\"\n  \", applies to certain\\ndesignated libraries.  This license is quite diff\"\n  \"erent from the ordinary\\none; be sure to read it in full, and don\\'t as\"\n  \"sume that anything in it is\\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\\n\\n  \"\n  \"The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\"\n  \"\\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding\"\n  \" to a\\nprogram and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, \"\n  \"without\\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the librar\"\n  \"y, and is\\nanalogous to running a utility program or application progra\"\n  \"m.  However, in\\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a \"\n  \"combined work, a\\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary \"\n  \"General Public License\\ntreats it as such.\\n\\n  Because of this blurred\"\n  \" distinction, using the ordinary General\\nPublic License for libraries \"\n  \"did not effectively promote software\\nsharing, because most developers \"\n  \"did not use the libraries.  We\\nconcluded that weaker conditions might \"\n  \"promote sharing better.\\n\\n  However, unrestricted linking of non-free \"\n  \"programs would deprive the\\nusers of those programs of all benefit from\"\n  \" the free status of the\\nlibraries themselves.  This Library General Pu\"\n  \"blic License is intended to\\npermit developers of non-free programs to \"\n  \"use free libraries, while\\npreserving your freedom as a user of such pr\"\n  \"ograms to change the free\\nlibraries that are incorporated in them.  (W\"\n  \"e have not seen how to achieve\\nthis as regards changes in header files\"\n  \", but we have achieved it as regards\\nchanges in the actual functions o\"\n  \"f the Library.)  The hope is that this\\nwill lead to faster development\"\n  \" of free libraries.\\n\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, \"\n  \"distribution and\\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the diff\"\n  \"erence between a\\n\\\"work based on the library\\\" and a \\\"work that uses \"\n  \"the library\\\".  The\\nformer contains code derived from the library, whi\"\n  \"le the latter only\\nworks together with the library.\\n\\n  Note that it \"\n  \"is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\\nGeneral Public\"\n  \" License rather than by this special one.\\n\\014\\n\\t\\t  GNU LIBRARY GENE\"\n  \"RAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION A\"\n  \"ND MODIFICATION\\n\\n  0.
