Further, the patent grant is revoked\r\nfrom anyone who files a patent lawsuit about code in LLVM - this protects the\r\ncommunity by providing a &quot;patent commons&quot; for the code base and reducing the\r\nodds of patent lawsuits in general.<\/p>\r\n<p>The license specifically scopes which patents are included with code\r\ncontributions.  To help explain this, the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.apache.org\/foundation\/license-faq.html\r\n\">Apache License FAQ<\/a> explains this scope using\r\nsome questions and answers, which we reproduce here for your convenience (for\r\nreference, the &quot;ASF&quot; is the Apache Software Foundation, the guidance still\r\nholds though):<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"highlight-default notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span><\/span>Q1: If I own a patent and contribute \r\nto a Work, and, at the time my\r\ncontribution is included in that Work, none of my patent&#39;s claims are subject\r\nto Apache&#39;s Grant of Patent License, is there a way any of those claims would\r\nlater become subject to the Grant of Patent License solely due to subsequent\r\ncontributions by other parties who are not licensees of that patent.\r\n\r\nA1: No.\r\n\r\nQ2: If at any time after my contribution, I am able to license other patent\r\nclaims that would have been subject to Apache&#39;s Grant of Patent License if\r\nthey were licenseable by me at the time of my contribution, do those other\r\nclaims become subject to the Grant of Patent License?\r\n\r\nA2: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ3: If I own or control a licensable patent and contribute code to a specific\r\nApache product, which of my patent claims are subject to Apache&#39;s Grant of\r\nPatent License?\r\n\r\nA3:  The only patent claims that are licensed to the ASF are those you own or\r\nhave the right to license that read on your contribution or on the\r\ncombination of your contribution with the specific Apache product to which\r\nyou contributed as it existed at the time of your contribution. No additional\r\npatent claims become licensed as a result of subsequent combinations of your\r\ncontribution with any other software. Note, however, that licensable patent\r\nclaims include those that you acquire in the future, as long as they read on\r\nyour original contribution as made at the original time. Once a patent claim\r\nis subject to Apache&#39;s Grant of Patent License, it is licensed under the\r\nterms of that Grant to the ASF and to recipients of any software distributed\r\nby the ASF for any Apache software product whatsoever.\r\n<\/pre><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"legacy-license-structure\">\r\n<span id=\"legacy\"><\/span><h3><a class=\"toc-backref\" href=\"#id29\">Legacy License Structure<\/a><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\r\n\"#legacy-license-structure\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶<\/a><\/h3>\r\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\r\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note<\/p>\r\n<p>The code base was previously licensed under the Terms described here.\r\nWe are in the middle of relicensing to a new approach (described above), but\r\nuntil this effort is complete, the code is also still available under these\r\nterms.  Once we finish the relicensing project, new versions of the code will\r\nnot be available under these terms.  However, nothing takes away your right\r\nto use old versions under the licensing terms under which they were\r\noriginally released.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>We intend to keep LLVM perpetually open source and to use a permissive open\r\nsource license.  The code in\r\nLLVM is available under the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/UoI-NCSA.php\">University \r\nof Illinois\/NCSA Open Source License<\/a>, which boils down to\r\nthis:<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"simple\">\r\n<li><p>You can freely distribute LLVM.<\/p><\/li>\r\n<li><p>You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute LLVM.<\/p><\/li>\r\n<li><p>Binaries derived from LLVM must reproduce the copyright notice (e.g. in an\r\nincluded README file).<\/p><\/li>\r\n<li><p>You can't use our names to promote your LLVM derived products.<\/p><\/li>\r\n<li><p>There's no warranty on LLVM at all.<\/p><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>We believe this fosters the widest adoption of LLVM because it <strong>allows\r\ncommercial products to be derived from LLVM<\/strong> with few restrictions and without\r\na requirement for making any derived works also open source (i.e. LLVM's\r\nlicense is not a &quot;copyleft&quot; license like the GPL). We suggest that you read the\r\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/UoI-NCSA.php\">License<\/a> if further\r\nclarification is needed.<\/p>\r\n<p>In addition to the UIUC license, the runtime library components of LLVM\r\n(<strong>compiler_rt, libc++, and libclc<\/strong>) are also licensed under the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/mit-license.php\r\n\">MIT License<\/a>, which does not contain\r\nthe binary redistribution clause.  As a user of these runtime libraries, it\r\nmeans that you can choose to use the code under either license (and thus don't\r\nneed the binary redistribution clause), and as a contributor to the code that\r\nyou agree that any contributions to these libraries be licensed under both\r\nlicenses.  We feel that this is important for runtime libraries, because they\r\nare implicitly linked into applications and therefore should not subject those\r\napplications to the binary redistribution clause. This also means that it is ok\r\nto move code from (e.g.)  libc++ to the LLVM core without concern, but that code","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"f08b6574-fb16-4c26-b5a9-e62d532f951b"}
