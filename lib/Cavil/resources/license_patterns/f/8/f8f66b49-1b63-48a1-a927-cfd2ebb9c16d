{"license":"GPL-3.0+","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The licenses for most software and other practical works  are  designed\n       to  take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n       the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n       share  and  change  all versions of a program - to make sure it remains\n       free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use\n       the  GNU  General  Public  License for most of our software; it applies\n       also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply\n       it to your programs, too.\n\n       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n       Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n       freedom  to  distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if\n       you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you  want  it,\n       that  you  can change the software or use pieces of it in new free pro-\n       grams, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n       To protect your rights, we need to  prevent  others  from  denying  you\n       these  rights  or  asking  you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you\n       have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,\n       or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n       For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n       or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\n       you  received.   You  must make sure that they, too, receive or can get\n       the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n       rights.\n\n       Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)\n       assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving\n       you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify it.\n\n       For  the  developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n       that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users'  and\n       authors'  sake,  the  GPL  requires that modified versions be marked as\n       changed, so that their problems will not be attributed  erroneously  to\n       authors of previous versions.\n\n       Some  devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modi-\n       fied versions of the software inside them,  although  the  manufacturer\n       can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protect-\n       ing users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic  pattern  of\n       such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which\n       is precisely  where  it  is  most  unacceptable.   Therefore,  we  have\n       designed  this  version  of  the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n       products.  If such problems arise substantially in  other  domains,  we\n       stand  ready  to  extend this provision to those domains in future ver-\n       sions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n       Finally, every program is threatened constantly  by  software  patents.\n       States  should  not  allow  patents  to restrict development and use of\n       software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n       avoid  the  special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n       make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n       patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n       The  precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modifi-\n       cation follow.\n\n                                TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n       0. Definitions.\n\n       \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n       \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n       works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n       \"The  Program\"  refers  to  any  copyrightable work licensed under this\n       License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and \"recip-\n       ients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n       To  \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n       in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the  making  of\n       an  exact  copy.   The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of\n       the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n       A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\n       the Program.\n\n       To  \"propagate\"  a work means to do anything with it that, without per-\n       mission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement\n       under  applicable  copyright  law, except executing it on a computer or\n       modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes  copying,  distribution\n       (with  or without modification), making available to the public, and in\n       some countries other activities as well.\n\n       To \"convey\" a work means any kind of  propagation  that  enables  other\n       parties  to  make  or  receive  copies.   Mere  interaction with a user\n       through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not  convey-\n       ing.\n\n       An  interactive  user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to\n       the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently  visible  fea-\n       ture  that  (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells\n       the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to  the  extent\n       that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under\n       this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface\n       presents  a  list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a promi-\n       nent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n       1. Source Code.\n\n       The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the  work  for\n       making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source form of\n       a work.\n\n       A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either  is  an  official\n       standard  defined  by  a  recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n       interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is\n       widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n       The  \"System  Libraries\"  of an executable work include anything, other\n       than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the  normal  form  of\n       packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Compo-\n       nent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the  work  with  that  Major\n       Component,  or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implemen-\n       tation is available to the public in source code form.  A \"Major Compo-\n       nent\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, win-\n       dow system, and so on) of the specific operating  system  (if  any)  on\n       which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work,\n       or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n       The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the\n       source  code  needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)\n       run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts  to  con-\n       trol  those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System\n       Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally  available  free  pro-\n       grams  which  are  used  unmodified  in performing those activities but\n       which are not part of the  work.   For  example,  Corresponding  Source\n       includes  interface  definition  files associated with source files for\n       the work, and the source code  for  shared  libraries  and  dynamically\n       linked  subprograms  that the work is specifically designed to require,\n       such as by intimate data communication or control  flow  between  those\n       subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n       The  Corresponding  Source  need  not  include  anything that users can\n       regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n       The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form  is  that  same\n       work.\n\n       2. Basic Permissions.\n\n       All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copy-\n       right on the Program, and are irrevocable provided  the  stated  condi-\n       tions  are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permis-\n       sion to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a  covered\n       work  is covered by this License only if the output, given its content,\n       constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your  rights  of\n       fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n       You  may  make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\n       without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in  force.\n       You  may  convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\n       them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facil-\n       ities  for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms\n       of this License in conveying all material for which you do not  control\n       copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must\n       do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control,  on\n       terms  that  prohibit  them  from making any copies of your copyrighted\n       material outside their relationship with you.\n\n       Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely  under  the\n       conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes\n       it unnecessary.\n\n       3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n       No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological mea-\n       sure  under  any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11\n       of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December  1996,  or  similar\n       laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\n       When  you  convey  a  covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n       circumvention of technological measures to the extent  such  circumven-\n       tion  is  effected by exercising rights under this License with respect\n       to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit  operation\n       or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n       users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid  circumvention  of\n       technological measures.\n\n       4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n       You  may  convey  verbatim  copies  of the Program's source code as you\n       receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously  and  appro-\n       priately  publish  on  each  copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep\n       intact all notices stating that this  License  and  any  non-permissive\n       terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all\n       notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a  copy\n       of this License along with the Program.\n\n       You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and\n       you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n       5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n       You may convey a work based on the Program,  or  the  modifications  to\n       produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms\n       of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n       a)  The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,\n           and giving a relevant date.\n\n       b)  The  work  must carry prominent notices stating that it is released\n           under this License and any conditions added under section 7.   This\n           requirement  modifies  the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact\n           all notices\".\n\n       c)  You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to\n           anyone  who  comes  into  possession  of a copy.  This License will\n           therefore apply, along with any  applicable  section  7  additional\n           terms,  to  the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of\n           how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license\n           the  work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permis-\n           sion if you have separately received it.\n\n       d)  If the work has interactive  user  interfaces,  each  must  display\n           Appropriate  Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n           interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work\n           need not make them do so.\n\n       A  compilation  of  a  covered work with other separate and independent\n       works, which are not by their nature extensions of  the  covered  work,\n       and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in\n       or on a volume of a  storage  or  distribution  medium,  is  called  an\n       \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used\n       to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's  users  beyond\n       what  the  individual  works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an\n       aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the  other  parts  of\n       the aggregate.\n\n       6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n       You  may  convey  a covered work in object code form under the terms of\n       sections 4 and 5, provided that you also  convey  the  machine-readable\n       Corresponding  Source  under the terms of this License, in one of these\n       ways:\n\n       a)  Convey the object code in,  or  embodied  in,  a  physical  product\n           (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Cor-\n           responding Source fixed on a durable  physical  medium  customarily\n           used for software interchange.\n\n       b)  Convey  the  object  code  in,  or  embodied in, a physical product\n           (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a  writ-\n           ten  offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as\n           you offer spare parts or customer support for that  product  model,\n           to  give  anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of\n           the Corresponding Source for all the software in the  product  that\n           is  covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customar-\n           ily used for software interchange, for a price no  more  than  your\n           reasonable  cost of physically performing this conveying of source,\n           or (2) access to copy  the  Corresponding  Source  from  a  network\n           server at no charge.\n\n       c)  Convey  individual  copies  of  the  object code with a copy of the\n           written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.   This  alterna-\n           tive  is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if\n           you received the object code with such an  offer,  in  accord  with\n           subsection 6b.\n\n       d)  Convey  the  object code by offering access from a designated place\n           (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corre-\n           sponding  Source  in the same way through the same place at no fur-\n           ther charge.  You need not require recipients to  copy  the  Corre-\n           sponding  Source  along with the object code.  If the place to copy\n           the object code is a network server, the Corresponding  Source  may\n           be  on  a  different server (operated by you or a third party) that\n           supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear\n           directions  next to the object code saying where to find the Corre-\n           sponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding\n           Source,  you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as\n           long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n       e)  Convey the object code using  peer-to-peer  transmission,  provided\n           you  inform  other  peers  where  the object code and Corresponding\n           Source of the work are being offered to the general  public  at  no\n           charge under subsection 6d.\n\n       A  separable  portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n       from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included\n       in conveying the object code work.\n\n       A  \"User  Product\"  is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n       tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n       or  household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorpora-\n       tion into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is  a  consumer\n       product,  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a\n       particular product received  by  a  particular  user,  \"normally  used\"\n       refers  to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless\n       of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the partic-\n       ular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.\n       A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the  product  has\n       substantial  commercial,  industrial  or non-consumer uses, unless such\n       uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n       \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, proce-\n       dures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and\n       execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a\n       modified  version  of  its  Corresponding Source.  The information must\n       suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n       code  is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modifi-\n       cation has been made.\n\n       If you convey an object code work under this section in,  or  with,  or\n       specifically  for  use  in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n       part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use  of  the\n       User  Product  is  transferred  to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n       fixed term (regardless of how the transaction  is  characterized),  the\n       Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by\n       the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not  apply  if\n       neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified\n       object code on the  User  Product  (for  example,  the  work  has  been\n       installed in ROM).\n\n       The  requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n       requirement to  continue  to  provide  support  service,  warranty,  or\n       updates  for  a work that has been modified or installed by the recipi-\n       ent, or for  the  User  Product  in  which  it  has  been  modified  or\n       installed.   Access  to  a  network may be denied when the modification\n       itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or\n       violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\n       Corresponding  Source  conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n       in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly  docu-\n       mented  (and  with  an implementation available to the public in source\n       code form), and must require no special password or key for  unpacking,\n       reading or copying.\n\n       7. Additional Terms.\n\n       \"Additional  permissions\"  are  terms that supplement the terms of this\n       License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  Addi-\n       tional  permissions  that are applicable to the entire Program shall be\n       treated as though they were included in this  License,  to  the  extent\n       that  they  are  valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n       apply only to part of the Program, that part  may  be  used  separately\n       under  those  permissions,  but  the entire Program remains governed by\n       this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n       When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove\n       any  additional  permissions  from  that  copy, or from any part of it.\n       (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal  in\n       certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional per-\n       missions on material, added by you to a covered  work,  for  which  you\n       have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n       Notwithstanding  any  other provision of this License, for material you\n       add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright  holders\n       of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n       a)  Disclaiming  warranty  or  limiting  liability differently from the\n           terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n       b)  Requiring preservation of specified  reasonable  legal  notices  or\n           author  attributions  in  that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n           Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n       c)  Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of  that  material,  or\n           requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in rea-\n           sonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n       d)  Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names  of  licensors  or\n           authors of the material; or\n\n       e)  Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade\n           names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n       f)  Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material\n           by  anyone  who  conveys  the material (or modified versions of it)\n           with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any\n           liability  that  these  contractual  assumptions directly impose on\n           those licensors and authors.\n\n       All other  non-permissive  additional  terms  are  considered  \"further\n       restrictions\"  within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n       received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating  that  it  is\n       governed  by  this License along with a term that is a further restric-\n       tion, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a  fur-\n       ther  restriction  but  permits  relicensing  or  conveying  under this\n       License, you may add to a covered work material governed by  the  terms\n       of  that  license  document, provided that the further restriction does\n       not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n       If you add terms to a covered work in accord  with  this  section,  you\n       must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional\n       terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where  to  find\n       the applicable terms.\n\n       Additional  terms,  permissive  or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n       form of a separately written license,  or  stated  as  exceptions;  the\n       above requirements apply either way.\n\n       8. Termination.\n\n       You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly pro-\n       vided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify\n       it  is  void,  and  will automatically terminate your rights under this\n       License (including any patent licenses granted under  the  third  para-\n       graph of section 11).\n\n       However,  if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\n       from a particular copyright holder  is  reinstated  (a)  provisionally,\n       unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates\n       your license, and (b) permanently, if the  copyright  holder  fails  to\n       notify  you  of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days\n       after the cessation.\n\n       Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\n       permanently  if  the  copyright holder notifies you of the violation by\n       some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received  notice\n       of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,\n       and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt  of  the\n       notice.\n\n       Termination  of  your  rights under this section does not terminate the\n       licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from  you  under\n       this  License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n       reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new  licenses  for  the  same\n       material under section 10.\n\n       9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n       You  are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\n       a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work  occur-\n       ring  solely  as  a  consequence  of using peer-to-peer transmission to\n       receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,  nothing\n       other  than  this  License grants you permission to propagate or modify\n       any covered work.  These actions  infringe  copyright  if  you  do  not\n       accept  this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered\n       work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n       10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n       Each time you  convey  a  covered  work,  the  recipient  automatically\n       receives  a  license  from  the  original licensors, to run, modify and\n       propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not  responsible\n       for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n       An  \"entity  transaction\"  is  a transaction transferring control of an\n       organization, or substantially all assets of  one,  or  subdividing  an\n       organization,  or  merging  organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n       work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction\n       who  receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the\n       work the party's predecessor in interest had or could  give  under  the\n       previous  paragraph,  plus  a  right to possession of the Corresponding\n       Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor\n       has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n       You  may  not  impose  any  further restrictions on the exercise of the\n       rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For  example,  you  may\n       not  impose  a  license  fee,  royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n       rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate  litigation\n       (including  a  cross-claim  or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n       any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,  offering  for\n       sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n       11. Patents.\n\n       A  \"contributor\"  is  a  copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n       License of the Program or a work on which the Program  is  based.   The\n       work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n       A  contributor's  \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\n       or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter\n       acquired,  that  would  be  infringed by some manner, permitted by this\n       License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,  but  do\n       not  include  claims  that  would be infringed only as a consequence of\n       further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of  this\n       definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\n       a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\n       Each contributor grants you a  non-exclusive,  worldwide,  royalty-free\n       patent  license  under  the  contributor's  essential patent claims, to\n       make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,  modify  and\n       propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n       In  the  following  three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n       agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce  a  patent\n       (such  as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n       sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent  license  to  a\n       party  means  to  make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n       patent against the party.\n\n       If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on  a  patent  license,\n       and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to\n       copy, free of charge and under the terms of  this  License,  through  a\n       publicly  available  network  server or other readily accessible means,\n       then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so avail-\n       able,  or  (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent\n       license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a  manner  consis-\n       tent  with  the  requirements  of  this  License,  to extend the patent\n       license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means  you  have\n       actual  knowledge  that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n       covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered  work\n       in  a  country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n       country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n       If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or  arrange-\n       ment,  you  convey,  or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered\n       work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties  receiving  the\n       covered  work  authorizing  them  to use, propagate, modify or convey a\n       specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is\n       automatically  extended to all recipients of the covered work and works\n       based on it.\n\n       A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within  the\n       scope  of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\n       the non-exercise of one or more of the  rights  that  are  specifically\n       granted  under  this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you\n       are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in  the  busi-\n       ness  of  distributing  software,  under  which you make payment to the\n       third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work,\n       and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would\n       receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license  (a)\n       in  connection  with  copies  of  the  covered work conveyed by you (or\n       copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in  connection\n       with  specific  products or compilations that contain the covered work,\n       unless you entered into that arrangement, or that  patent  license  was\n       granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n       Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any\n       implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be\n       available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n       12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n       If  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n       otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do  not\n       excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n       covered work so as to satisfy  simultaneously  your  obligations  under\n       this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\n       you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms  that\n       obligate  you  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to\n       whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both  those\n       terms  and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\n       Program.\n\n       13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you  have  permis-\n       sion  to  link  or  combine any covered work with a work licensed under\n       version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a  single  com-\n       bined  work,  and  to  convey  the  resulting  work.  The terms of this\n       License will continue to apply to the part which is the  covered  work,\n       but  the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n       section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to  the\n       combination as such.\n\n       14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n       The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\n       the GNU General Public License from time to time.   Such  new  versions\n       will  be  similar  in  spirit to the present version, but may differ in\n       detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the  Program\n       specifies  that  a  certain  numbered version of the GNU General Public\n       License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have  the  option  of\n       following  the  terms and conditions either of that numbered version or\n       of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the\n       Program  does  not  specify  a version number of the GNU General Public\n       License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n       Foundation.\n\n       If  the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\n       of the GNU General Public License can  be  used,  that  proxy's  public\n       statement  of  acceptance  of  a  version permanently authorizes you to\n       choose that version for the Program.\n\n       Later license versions may give you  additional  or  different  permis-\n       sions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or\n       copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow  a  later  ver-\n       sion.\n\n       15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n       THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLI-\n       CABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLD-\n       ERS  AND\/OR  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n       OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,  BUT  NOT  LIMITED\n       TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTIC-\n       ULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n       PROGRAM  IS  WITH  YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n       THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n       16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n       IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO  IN  WRITING\n       WILL  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND\/OR CON-\n       VEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE  LIABLE  TO  YOU  FOR  DAMAGES,\n       INCLUDING  ANY  GENERAL,  SPECIAL,  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n       ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM  (INCLUDING  BUT\n       NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES\n       SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO  OPER-\n       ATE  WITH  ANY  OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS\n       BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n       17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n       If the disclaimer of warranty  and  limitation  of  liability  provided\n       above  cannot  be  given  local  legal effect according to their terms,\n       reviewing courts shall apply local law that most  closely  approximates\n       an  absolute  waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Pro-\n       gram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies  a  copy\n       of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n       If  you  develop  a  new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n       possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make  it\n       free  software  which  everyone can redistribute and change under these\n       terms.\n\n       To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to\n       attach  them to the start of each source file to most effectively state\n       the exclusion of warranty; and each  file  should  have  at  least  the\n       \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n           <  one  line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it\n           does.  >\n           Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >\n\n           This program is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or  mod-\n           ify  it  under  the terms of the GNU General Public License as pub-\n           lished by the Free Software Foundation, either  version  3  of  the\n           License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n           This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n           WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the  implied  warranty  of  MER-\n           CHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Gen-\n           eral Public License for more details.\n\n           You should have received a copy of the GNU General  Public  License\n           along      with      this      program.       If      not,      see\n           <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.\n\n       Also add information on how to contact  you  by  electronic  and  paper\n       mail.\n\n       If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice\n       like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n           <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n           This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;  for  details  type\n           \"show  w\".   This  is  free software, and you are welcome to redis-\n           tribute it under certain conditions; type \"show c\" for details.\n\n       The hypothetical commands \"show w\" and \"show c\" should show the  appro-\n       priate  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's\n       commands might be different; for a GUI  interface,  you  would  use  an\n       \"about box\".\n\n       You  should  also  get  your  employer (if you work as a programmer) or\n       school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for  the  program,  if\n       necessary.   For  more information on this, and how to apply and follow\n       the GNU GPL, see <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.\n\n       The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your  pro-\n       gram  into  proprietary  programs.   If  your  program  is a subroutine\n       library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking  proprietary\n       applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the\n       GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.
