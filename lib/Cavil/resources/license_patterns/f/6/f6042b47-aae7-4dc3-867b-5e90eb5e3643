{"license":"any perm mark changes","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"My  goal  is  to  see  software  developers  adopt  this grammar as a \nstandard until such time as a better  standard  is  accessible.   The \nonly  way  to  get it to become a standard, is to be sure that people \nknow that derivations are based on a specific work.   The  intent  of \nreleasing  this  grammar is to provide a publicly accessible standard \ngrammar for C++.  The intent of the  copyright  notice  is  to  allow \narbitrary  commercial  and non-commercial use of the grammar, as long \nas reference is given to the original standard.  Without reference to \na specific standard, many alternative  grammars  would  develop.   By \nreferring  to  the  standard,  this grammar is given publicity, which \nshould lead to further use in compatible products and  systems.   The \nbenefits  of  such  a  standard  to  commercial  products  (browsers, \nbeautifiers, translators, compilers, ...) should be  obvious  to  the \ndevelopers,  in  that  other compatible products will emerge, and the \nvalue of all conforming products  will  rise.   Most  developers  are \naware  of  the  value  of  acquiring  a fairly complete grammar for a \nlanguage, and the copyright notice  (and  the  resulting  affiliation \nwith my work) should not be too high a price to pay.  By copyrighting \nthis  grammar,  I have some minor control over what this standard is, \nand I can (hopefully) keep it from degrading without my approval.   I \nwill  consistently  attempt  to  provide  upgraded  grammars that are \ncompliant  with  the  current  art,  and  the  ANSI   C++   Committee \nrecommendation  in  particular.   A developer is never prevented from \nmodifying the grammar to improve it in  whatever  way  is  seen  fit.  \nThere  is  also  no  restriction on the sale of copies, or derivative \nworks, providing the requests in the copyright notice are satisfied.\n\nIf you are not \"copying\" my work, but  are  rather  only  abstracting \nsome  of  the  standard,  an acknowledgment with references to such a \nstandard would be appreciated.  Specifically,  agreements  with  this \nstandard  as  to  the  resolution  of otherwise ambiguous constructs, \nshould be noted.\n\nSimply put: \"make whatever use you would like  of  the  grammar,  but \ninclude  the  ``portions  Copyright  ...''  as  a  reference  to this \nstandard","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"f6042b47-aae7-4dc3-867b-5e90eb5e3643"}
