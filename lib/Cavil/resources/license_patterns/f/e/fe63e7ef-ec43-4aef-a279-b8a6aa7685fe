We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the @dfn{Lesser} General Public License because it\ndoes @emph{Less} to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n``work based on the library'' and a ``work that uses the library''.  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n@subheading TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n@enumerate 0\n@item\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other program\nwhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other\nauthorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this\nLesser General Public License (also called ``this License'').  Each\nlicensee is addressed as ``you''.\n\n  A ``library'' means a collection of software functions and\/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The ``Library'', below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A ``work based on the\nLibrary'' means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term ``modification''.)\n\n  ``Source code'' for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n@item\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n@item\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n@enumerate a\n@item\nThe modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n@item\nYou must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n@item\nYou must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\ncharge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n@item\nIf a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\ntable of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\nthe facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\nis invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\nin the event an application does not supply such function or\ntable, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\nits purpose remains meaningful.\n\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\na purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\napplication.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\napplication-supplied function or table used by this function must\nbe optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\nroot function must still compute square roots","risk":1,"spdx":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"fe63e7ef-ec43-4aef-a279-b8a6aa7685fe"}
