No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\r\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\r\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\r\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\r\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\r\n               Material.\r\n .\r\n       6.

Other rights.\r\n .\r\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\r\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\r\n          privacy, and\/or other similar personality rights; however, to\r\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and\/or agrees not to\r\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\r\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\r\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\r\n .\r\n       2.
