Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\r\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\r\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\r\nlimited to, the following:\r\n\r\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\r\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\r\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and\/or performer(s);\r\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\r\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\r\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\r\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\r\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\r\n     in a Work;\r\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96\/9\/EC of the\r\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\r\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\r\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\r\n     directive); and\r\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\r\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\r\n     implementations thereof.\r\n\r\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\r\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\r\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\r\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\r\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\r\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\r\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\r\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\r\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\r\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\r\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\r\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\r\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\r\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\r\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\r\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\r\n\r\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\r\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\r\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\r\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\r\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\r\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\r\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\r\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\r\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\r\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\r\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\r\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\r\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\r\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\r\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\r\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\r\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\r\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\r\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\r\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\r\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\r\n\r\n4.
