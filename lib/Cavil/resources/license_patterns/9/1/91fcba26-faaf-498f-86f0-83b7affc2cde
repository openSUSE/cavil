By contrast, the GNU General\nPublic Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share\nand change free software--to make sure the software is free for\nall its users.\n\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to\nsome specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and\nto any other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can\nuse it for your libraries, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\nthat you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software\n(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive\nsource code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\nyou know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\nfor you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you\nmodify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights\nthat we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or\ncan get the source code.
