Meta-< does not take you to the beginning of\n;; the code, it takes you a windowfull or two away, which can be tedious on\n;; slow terminal lines.\n;;\n;; I know what the copyright notice says; so this code makes all but the first\n;; line of it be invisible, by using Emacs's selective-display feature.  The\n;; text is still present and unmodified, but it is invisible.\n;;\n;; Elide the copyright notice with \"Meta-X hide-copyleft-region\".  Make it\n;; visible again with \"Control-U Meta-X hide-copyleft-region\".  Or, if you're\n;; sure you're not gonna get sued, you can do something like this in your\n;; .emacs file","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"9d26b690-ed51-4ead-9d5d-585c0ae2dbca"}
