Definitions.\r\n\r\n   \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity\r\n   authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with\r\n   the Author. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and\r\n   all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under\r\n   common control with that entity are considered to be a single\r\n   Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i)\r\n   the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of\r\n   such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of\r\n   fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)\r\n   beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n   \"Contribution\" shall mean any original work of authorship,\r\n   including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is\r\n   intentionally submitted by You to the Author for inclusion in, or\r\n   documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Author\r\n   (the \"Work\"). For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means\r\n   any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the\r\n   Author or its representatives, including but not limited to\r\n   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control\r\n   systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf\r\n   of, the Author for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,\r\n   but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\r\n   designated in writing by You as \"Not a Contribution.\"\r\n\r\n2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\r\n   this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Author and to recipients of\r\n   software distributed by the Author a perpetual, worldwide,\r\n   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license\r\n   to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\r\n   perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such\r\n   derivative works.\r\n\r\n3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\r\n   this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Author and to recipients of\r\n   software distributed by the Author a perpetual, worldwide,\r\n   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated\r\n   in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to\r\n   sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such\r\n   license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are\r\n   necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination\r\n   of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)\r\n   was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You\r\n   or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\r\n   lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you\r\n   have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent\r\n   infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under\r\n   this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the\r\n   date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n4.

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original\r\n   creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).  You\r\n   represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details\r\n   of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not\r\n   limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are\r\n   personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your\r\n   Contributions.\r\n\r\n6.

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,\r\n   You may submit it to the Author separately from any Contribution,\r\n   identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or\r\n   other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents,\r\n   trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware,\r\n   and conspicuously marking the work as \"Submitted on behalf of a\r\n   third-party: [named here]\".\r\n\r\n8.
