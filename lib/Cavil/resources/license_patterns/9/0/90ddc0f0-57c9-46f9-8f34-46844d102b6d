PREAMBLE\n#\n# The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n# functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\n# assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\n# with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\n# Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\n# to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\n# for modifications made by others.\n#\n# This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\n# works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\n# complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\n# license designed for free software.\n#\n# We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\n# software, because free software needs free documentation: a free\n# program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\n# software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\n# it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\n# whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\n# principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n#\n#\n# 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n#\n# This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\n# contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\n# distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\n# world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\n# work under the conditions stated herein.  The \"Document\", below,\n# refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\n# licensee, and is addressed as \"you\".  You accept the license if you\n# copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\n# under copyright law.\n#\n# A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\n# Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\n# modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n#\n# A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\n# the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\n# publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n# (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\n# within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\n# textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\n# mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\n# connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\n# commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\n# them.\n#\n# The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\n# are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\n# that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\n# section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\n# allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\n# Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\n# Sections then there are none.\n#\n# The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\n# as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\n# the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\n# be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n#\n# A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n# represented in a format whose specification is available to the\n# general public, that is suitable for revising the document\n# straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\n# pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\n# drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\n# for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\n# to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\n# format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\n# or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\n# An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\n# of text.  A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n#\n# Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\n# ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\n# or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\n# HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\n# transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\n# include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\n# proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or\n# processing tools are not generally available, and the\n# machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\n# processors for output purposes only.\n#\n# The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\n# plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\n# this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\n# formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\n# the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\n# preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n#\n# A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\n# title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\n# text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\n# specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\",\n# \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)  To \"Preserve the Title\"\n# of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\n# section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n#\n# The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\n# states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\n# Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\n# License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\n# implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\n# no effect on the meaning of this License","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"90ddc0f0-57c9-46f9-8f34-46844d102b6d"}
