By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\nmake sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\nLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to\nany other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\nSoftware Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public\nLicense instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you\nwish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you\ncan change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\nyou know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to\ndeny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or\nfor a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You\nmust make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you\nmust show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand\/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If\nthe software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its\nrecipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any\nproblems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\nreputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We\nwish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be\nlicensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\nthe terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to\nany such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either\nthe Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a\nwork containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\ntranslation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the\nProgram is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only\nif its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of\nhaving been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\nwhat the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\nof the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\nmay at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n   * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n   * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n     under the terms of this License.\n\n   * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n     in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\n     including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is\n     no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that\n     users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling\n     the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\n     Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\n     announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\n     an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be\nreasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\nthis License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you\ndistribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\nsections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the\ndistribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\npermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\neach and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\nthe right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\nbased on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\nthe Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage\nor distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of\nthis License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n   * a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n   * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\n     to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of\n     physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\n     copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the\n     terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\n     software interchange; or,\n\n   * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n     program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n     accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source\ncode distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in\neither source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,\nand so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless\nthat component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to\ncopy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,\neven though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\nthe object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except\nas expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\nwho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not\nhave their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\ncompliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed\nit. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\nProgram or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\nProgram (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms\nand conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so\nas to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\nother pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute\nthe Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies\ndirectly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy\nboth it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of\nthe Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents\nor other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;\nthis section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free\nsoftware distribution system, which is implemented by public license\npractices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range\nof software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\napplication of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or\nshe is willing to distribute software through any other system and a\nlicensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so\nthat distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\nthe General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of\npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\npromoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO\nTHE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM\nPROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free\nsoftware which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the\nexclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\"\nline and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) 19yy  name of author\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\nFoundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when\nit starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\ntype `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\nto redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'\nfor details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\ninterest in the program `Gnomovision'\n(which makes passes at compilers) written\nby James Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\nTy Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\nLicense instead of this License","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"952857f7-190b-45e8-b661-17cfdc9f2f06"}
