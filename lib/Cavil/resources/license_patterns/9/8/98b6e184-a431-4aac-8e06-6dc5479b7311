If you make a million dollars with it, it would be nice if you would share. If you make compositions with it, put us in the program notes.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the concepts are covered by various patents, some known to us and likely others that are unknown. Many of the ones known to us are administered by the Stanford Office of Technology and Licensing. The good news is that large hunks of the techniques used here are public domain. To avoid subtle legal issues, we will not state what's freely useable here, but we will try to note within the various classes where certain things are likely to be protected by patents.<\/p>\n<h4>License<\/h4>\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<\/p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<\/p>\n<p>Any person wishing to distribute modifications to the Software is asked to send the modifications to the original developer so that they can be incorporated into the canonical version.

We've been hacking on this code for a while now and most of it seems to work pretty well. But, there surely are some bugs floating around. Sometimes things work fine on one computer platform but not so fine on another. FPU overflows and underflows cause <em>very<\/em> weird behavior that also depends on the particular CPU and OS.
