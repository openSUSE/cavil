This license may be\n  particularly suitable if your work is \\TeX-related (such as a\n  \\LaTeX\\ package), but you may use it with small modifications even\n  if your work is unrelated to \\TeX.\n\n  The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS\n  LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations\n  for authors who are considering distributing their works under this\n  license.\n\n  This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\n  and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\n  that work may be distributed.\n\n  We, the \\LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\n  the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work\n  that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\n  maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that\n  work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting\n  these conditions, then read the document \\LPPLdocfile{cfgguide} and\n  \\LPPLdocfile{modguide} in the base \\LaTeX\\ distribution for suggestions.\n\n\n  \\LPPLsubsection{Definitions}\n  In this license document the following terms are used:\n\n  \\begin{description}\n  \\item[Work] Any work being distributed under this License.\n\n  \\item[Derived Work] Any work that under any applicable law is\n    derived from the Work.\n\n  \\item[Modification] Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under\n    any applicable law -- for example, the production of a file\n    containing an original file associated with the Work or a\n    significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or with\n    modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n\n  \\item[Modify] To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work\n    under any applicable law.\n    \n  \\item[Distribution] Making copies of the Work available from one\n    person to another, in whole or in part.  Distribution includes\n    (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the\n    Work accessible by file transfer protocols such as \\textsc{ftp} or\n    \\textsc{http} or by shared file systems such as Sun's Network File\n    System (\\textsc{nfs}).\n\n  \\item[Compiled Work] A version of the Work that has been processed\n    into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system.\n    This processing may include using installation facilities provided\n    by the Work, transformations of the Work, copying of components of\n    the Work, or other activities.  Note that modification of any\n    installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes\n    modification of the Work.\n\n  \\item[Current Maintainer] A person or persons nominated as such\n    within the Work.  If there is no such explicit nomination then it\n    is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.\n\n  \\item[Base Interpreter] A program or process that is normally needed\n    for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.\n    \n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are\n    not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\n    `\\LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the\n    `\\LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `\\TeX{} language'.\n  \\end{description}\n\n  \\LPPLsubsection{Conditions on Distribution and Modification}\n\n  \\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Activities other than distribution and\/or modification of the\n    Work are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.\n    In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and\n    no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the\n    Work.\n\n  \\item\\label{distribute} You may distribute a complete, unmodified\n    copy of the Work as you received it.  Distribution of only part of\n    the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to\n    distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of\n    this clause.\n\n  \\item You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated\n    from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under\n    Clause~\\ref{distribute} above, as long as that Compiled Work is\n    distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the\n    Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been\n    installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the\n    Work.\n\n  \\item\\label{currmaint} If you are the Current Maintainer of the\n    Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus creating\n    a Derived Work.  You may also distribute the Derived Work without\n    restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the Derived\n    Work.  Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current\n    Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.\n\n  \\item If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\n    modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based\n    on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a\n    Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.\n\n  \\item\\label{conditions} If you are not the Current Maintainer of the\n    Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the following\n    conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that\n    component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt\n    from that condition.  Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to\n    add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct\n      replacement for a component of the Work when that component is\n      used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of\n      the Work identifies itself to the user when used interactively\n      with that Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this\n      Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a\n      modified version of this component to the user when used\n      interactively with that Base Interpreter.\n     \n    \\item Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent\n      notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component,\n      or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as\n      part of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and\n      accurate log of the changes.\n  \n    \\item No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\n      including (but not limited to) the authors of the original\n      version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not\n      limited to) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients\n      of the Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly\n      that they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\n\n    \\item You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\n      \\begin{enumerate}\n      \\item A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your\n        distribution of a modified component is made by offering\n        access to copy the modified component from a designated place,\n        then offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same\n        or some similar place meets this condition, even though third\n        parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the\n        modified component;\n\n      \\item Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,\n        unmodified copy of the Work.\n      \\end{enumerate}\n    \\end{enumerate}\n  \\item If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\n    distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long\n    as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the\n    Compiled Work, and as long as the conditions of\n    Clause~\\ref{conditions}, above, are met with regard to the Derived\n    Work.\n\n  \\item The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence\n    do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component\n    so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that\n    component of the Work as it is distributed by the Current\n    Maintainer under Clause~\\ref{currmaint}, above.\n\n  \\item Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\n    format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part)\n    is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not\n    relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to\n    the results of applying that process.\n     \n  \\item \\null\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\n      provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\n      Clause~\\ref{conditions} above, in regard to the Work, though it\n      does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this\n      license.\n      \n    \\item If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license,\n      that Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part\n      of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor\n      the restrictions in Clause~\\ref{conditions} above, concerning\n      changes from the Work.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n  \\item This license places no restrictions on works that are\n    unrelated to the Work, nor does this license place any\n    restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means.\n\n  \\item Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to,\n    prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable\n    laws.\n  \\end{enumerate}\n\n  \\LPPLsubsection{No Warranty","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"1cede71e-eae9-404e-b662-cf908384ec75"}
