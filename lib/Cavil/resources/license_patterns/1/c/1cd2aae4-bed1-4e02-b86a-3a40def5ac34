For grayscale images with up to\n    6 bit per pixel, JBIG performs superior to JPEG's lossless\n    mode.\n\nJBIG-KIT can be used as free software under the GNU General Public\nLicense. Other license arrangements more suitable for commercial\napplications are available as well, please contact the author for\ndetails. JBIG-KIT provides two portable libraries implemented in\nANSI\/ISO C for encoding and decoding JBIG data streams, along with\ndocumentation. The first library, jbig.c, implements nearly all of the\noptions that the JBIG standard provides, but keeps the entire\nuncompressed image in memory. The second library, jbig85.c, implements\nonly the ITU-R T.85 subset of the standard that black\/white fax\nmachines use (single bit per pixel, no \"progressive\" encoding), and\nkeeps only three lines of the uncompressed image in memory, making it\nparticularly attractive for low-memory embedded applications","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"1cd2aae4-bed1-4e02-b86a-3a40def5ac34"}
