This\r\n    license terminates for you if you sue someone over their\r\n    open-source software implementation of OCB claiming that you have\r\n    a patent covering their implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n License for Open Source Software Implementations of OCB\r\n January 9, 2013\r\n\r\n 1 Definitions\r\n\r\n 1.1 “Licensor” means Phillip Rogaway.\r\n\r\n 1.2 “Licensed Patents” means any patent that claims priority to United\r\n States Patent Application No. 09\/918,615 entitled “Method and Apparatus\r\n for Facilitating Efficient Authenticated Encryption,” and any utility,\r\n divisional, provisional, continuation, continuations-in-part, reexamination,\r\n reissue, or foreign counterpart patents that may issue with respect to the\r\n aforesaid patent application.
