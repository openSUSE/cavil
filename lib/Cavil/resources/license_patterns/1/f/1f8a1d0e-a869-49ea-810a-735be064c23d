You should also\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as\nin 2b) above.\n\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n======================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\nworks under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\nthis section.\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*\nconditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then\ndo not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\ndistribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text\nof this license as a model for your own license, but your license\nshould not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\ndistributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\ncause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your\nbest interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\none.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work\nwas authored and\/or last substantially modified.  Include also a\nstatement that the distribution and\/or modification of that\ncomponent is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n  %% pig.dtx\n  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name\n  %\n  % This work may be distributed and\/or modified under the\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n  % The latest version of this license is in\n  %   http:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/lppl.txt\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n  % version 2005\/12\/01 or later.\n  %\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.\n  % \n  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\n  %\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions\ngiven in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring\nto the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being\ngenerated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\nreferring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and\n`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\n\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\nWork, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.  \nHowever, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance\nsection was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to\nthe community even when you can no longer maintain and support it\nyourself.\n\nDerived Works That Are Not Replacements\n---------------------------------------\n\nSeveral clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and\nstability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves\nwith the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a\n(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If\nthis is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a\ncompletely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.\n\n\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\n Defining What Constitutes the Work\n\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\n   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\n   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by\n   using a line such as:\n\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n   \n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\n   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be\n   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"1f8a1d0e-a869-49ea-810a-735be064c23d"}
