COMBINING DOCUMENTS\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,\nunder the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you\ninclude in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,\nunmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license\nnotice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical\nInvariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant\nSections with the same name but diﬀerent contents, make the title of each such section\nunique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or\npublisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment\nto the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined\nwork.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”; likewise combine any\nsections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You\nmust delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released\nunder this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various\ndocuments with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you\nfollow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all\nother respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted\ndocument, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of\nthat document.\n\n\fAppendix A: GNU Free Documentation License\n\n17\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent\ndocuments or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called\nan “aggregate” if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the\nlegal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When\nthe Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other\nworks in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,\nthen if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover\nTexts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they\nmust appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations\nof the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with\ntranslations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may\ninclude translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions\nof these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the\nlicense notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you\nalso include the original English version of this License and the original versions of\nthose notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and\nthe original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\nprevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require\nchanging the actual title.\n9. TERMINATION\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or\ndistribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular\ncopyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder\nexplicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days\nafter the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if\nthe copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the\nnotice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties\nwho have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have\nbeen terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the\nsame material does not give you any rights to use it.\n\n\fAppendix A: GNU Free Documentation License\n\n18\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free\nDocumentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\nto the present version, but may diﬀer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nSee http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document\nspecifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or any later version”\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\nspecified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free\nSoftware Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of this License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a\nversion permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\n11. RELICENSING\n“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World Wide\nWeb server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities\nfor anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of\nsuch a server. A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the\nsite means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal\nplace of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that\nlicense published by that same organization.\n“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part\nof another Document.\nAn MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License, and if all works\nthat were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and\nsubsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts\nor invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under\nCC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is\neligible for relicensing.\n\n\fAppendix A: GNU Free Documentation License\n\n19\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the\ndocument and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\nCopyright (C) year your name.\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\nor any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\nwith no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover\nTexts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ‘‘GNU\nFree Documentation License’’.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the\n“with. . . Texts.” line with this:\nwith the Invariant Sections being list their titles, with\nthe Front-Cover Texts being list, and with the Back-Cover Texts\nbeing list.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the\nthree, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing\nthese examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU\nGeneral Public License, to permit their use in free software.\n\n\fAppendix B: Concept Index","risk":2,"spdx":"GFDL-1.3-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"18be2269-e9da-4a40-89f6-3ab3732da84c"}
