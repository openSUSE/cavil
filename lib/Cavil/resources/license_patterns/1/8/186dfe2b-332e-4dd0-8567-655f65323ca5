Only one passage of Front-Cover\nText and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements\nmade by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text\nfor the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by\nthe same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;\nbut you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the\nprevious publisher that added the old one.\n\n   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n----------------------\n\n   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license\nnotice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding\nat the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or\npublisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.  Make the\nsame adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections\nin the license notice of the combined work.\n\n   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,\nand any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all sections\nEntitled “Endorsements.”\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n---------------------------\n\n   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other\ndocuments released under this License, and replace the individual copies\nof this License in the various documents with a single copy that is\nincluded in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this\nLicense for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other\nrespects.\n\n   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and\ndistribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a\ncopy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that\ndocument.\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n-------------------------------------\n\n   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting\nfrom the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the\ncompilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.  When the\nDocument is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the\nother works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works\nof the Document.\n\n   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers\nthat bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic\nequivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.  Otherwise\nthey must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n--------------\n\n   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the\ntranslation and the original version of this License or a notice or\ndisclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\n   If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,\n“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its\nTitle (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n--------------\n\n   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your\nreceipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does\nnot give you any rights to use it.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n------------------------------------\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the\nGNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.  See\n<http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/>.\n\n   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies\nthat a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be\nused, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version\npermanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\n\n11. RELICENSING\n---------------\n\n   “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any\nWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\nprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A public\nwiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A “Massive\nMultiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any\nset of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n   “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nlicense published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit\ncorporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft versions of that license\npublished by that same organization.\n\n   “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or\nin part, as part of another Document.\n\n   An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this\nLicense, and if all works that were first published under this License\nsomewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or\nin part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and\n(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\n\n   The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the\nsite under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,\nprovided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n====================================================\n\n   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and license\nnotices just after the title page:\n\n     Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\n     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or\n     any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with\n     no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n     A copy of the license is included in the section entitled\n     ``GNU Free Documentation License''.\n\n   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover\nTexts, replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:\n\n     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts\n     being LIST.\n\n   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n\n   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free\nsoftware license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit\ntheir use in free software.\n\n\u001f\nFile: ccd2cue.info,  Node: The GNU Manifesto,  Next: The GNU Project,  Prev: GNU Free Documentation License,  Up: Top\n\nAppendix E The GNU Manifesto\n****************************\n\nThe GNU Manifesto was written by Richard Stallman at the beginning of\nthe GNU Project, to ask for participation and support.  For the first\nfew years, it was updated in minor ways to account for developments, but\nnow it seems best to leave it unchanged as most people have seen it.\nSince that time, we have learned about certain common misunderstandings\nthat different wording could help avoid.  Footnotes added since 1993\nhelp clarify these points.  For up-to-date information about the\navailable GNU software, please see the information available on our web\nserver, in particular our list of software.  For how to contribute, see\n<http:\/\/gnu.org\/help>.  “The GNU Manifesto” was originally published in\n‘Dr. Dobb’s Journal,’ vol. 10, n. 3 (March 1985).\n\nThis document is part of GNU philosophy, the GNU Project’s exhaustive\ncollection of articles and essays about free software and related\nmatters.\n\n   Copyright © 1985, 1993, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 Free\nSoftware Foundation, Inc.\n\n     Verbatim copying and distribution of this entire appendix are\n     permitted worldwide, without royalty, in any medium, provided this\n     notice is preserved.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nWhat’s GNU? Gnu’s Not Unix!\n---------------------------\n\n   GNU, which stands for Gnu’s Not Unix, is the name for the complete\nUnix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it\naway free to everyone who can use it.(1)  Several other volunteers are\nhelping me.  Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are\ngreatly needed.\n\n   So far we have an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing editor\ncommands, a source level debugger, a yacc-compatible parser generator, a\nlinker, and around 35 utilities.  A shell (command interpreter) is\nnearly completed.  A new portable optimizing C compiler has compiled\nitself and may be released this year.  An initial kernel exists but many\nmore features are needed to emulate Unix.  When the kernel and compiler\nare finished, it will be possible to distribute a GNU system suitable\nfor program development.  We will use TeX as our text formatter, but an\nnroff is being worked on.  We will use the free, portable X window\nsystem as well.  After this we will add a portable Common Lisp, an\nEmpire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of other things, plus online\ndocumentation.  We hope to supply, eventually, everything useful that\nnormally comes with a Unix system, and more.\n\n   GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to\nUnix.  We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our\nexperience with other operating systems.  In particular, we plan to have\nlonger file names, file version numbers, a crashproof file system, file\nname completion perhaps, terminal-independent display support, and\nperhaps eventually a Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp\nprograms and ordinary Unix programs can share a screen.  Both C and Lisp\nwill be available as system programming languages.  We will try to\nsupport UUCP, MIT Chaosnet, and Internet protocols for communication.\n\n   GNU is aimed initially at machines in the 68000\/16000 class with\nvirtual memory, because they are the easiest machines to make it run on.\nThe extra effort to make it run on smaller machines will be left to\nsomeone who wants to use it on them.\n\n   To avoid horrible confusion, please pronounce the _g_ in the word\n“GNU” when it is the name of this project.\n\nWhy I Must Write GNU\n--------------------\n\n   I consider that the Golden Rule requires that if I like a program I\nmust share it with other people who like it.
