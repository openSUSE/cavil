The\n * library is licensed under the\n * <A HREF=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/lesser.html\">LGPL<\/A>.\n * Complete source code of libFLAC as well as the command-line\n * encoder and plugins is available and is a useful source of\n * examples.\n *\n * Aside from encoders and decoders, libFLAC provides a powerful\n * metadata interface for manipulating metadata in FLAC files.  It\n * allows the user to add, delete, and modify FLAC metadata blocks\n * and it can automatically take advantage of PADDING blocks to avoid\n * rewriting the entire FLAC file when changing the size of the\n * metadata.\n *\n * libFLAC usually only requires the standard C library and C math\n * library. In particular, threading is not used so there is no\n * dependency on a thread library. However, libFLAC does not use\n * global variables and should be thread-safe.\n *\n * There is also a new libOggFLAC library which wraps around libFLAC\n * to provide routines for encoding to and decoding from FLAC streams\n * inside an Ogg container.  The interfaces are very similar or identical\n * to their counterparts in libFLAC.  libOggFLAC is also licensed under\n * the LGPL","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"17e3681f-ae15-42c5-a631-4ca17f58d716"}
