{"license":"GPL-2.0+","opinion":0,"packname":"xemacs-packages","patent":0,"pattern":"This document may be redistributed, verbatim or in modified form, under\nthe terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or any later\nversion.  The same terms apply to the libraries it documents.  A copy\nof the General Public License is provided as an Appendix.\n\nMost XEmacs documentation has its own license, which is an ancestor of\nthe GNU Free Documentation License (@dfn{FDL}), and whose terms are\nquite similar to those imposed by GNU on Emacs documentation.  Why is\nthis manual licensed differently (under the GNU General Public License,\nor @dfn{GPL}), and why does it have to be distributed separately from\nthe XEmacs User's Guide and the XEmacs Lisp Reference Manual?\n\nTaking the second question first, XEmacs is @dfn{community-owned}\nsoftware.  That is, unlike GNU Emacs, there is no monopoly copyright\nholder.  Many of us, including the original Lucid authors, have\ncontributed our copyrights to the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and of\ncourse much content is derived from GNU Emacs, and therefore is held by\nthe FSF.  Another large chunk is held by Sun Microsystems, and a few\nindividual authors hold copyright to thousands of lines each.  But many\nindividuals hold copyright to only a few dozen lines.  Like the Linux\nkernel, copyright ownership is distributed throughout a community.\n\nHowever, its license is ``copyleft,'' @emph{i.e.}, it @emph{requires}\nthat you redistribute it under terms @emph{identical} to those under\nwhich you received it, unless you have explicit permission of the\ncopyright holder.  Because of the multiple owners, determining the\nownership of any given part of XEmacs is tedious, and perhaps\nimpossible.  For practical purposes, then, the license of any\nsubstantial chunk of existing XEmacs content cannot be changed, except\nto a later version of the GPL, for those parts under GPL.  (That is due\nto the @emph{explicit} permission to change to a later version of the\nGPL, present in every file of XEmacs.)\n\nUnfortunately, this severe restriction means that the GPL, FDL, and the\nXEmacs documentation license (@dfn{XDL}) are @emph{mutually\nincompatible}.  That is, content licensed under any of the GPL, FDL, or\nXDL @emph{may not} be mixed with content licensed under either of the\nother two without changing the license of some of the content.  But this\nrequires permission of the copyright holder, which is often difficult or\nimpossible to get.\n\nFor example, you @emph{may not} take comments or docstrings from XEmacs\ncode and add them to the Lispref to mend a gap in the latter's coverage.\nYou @emph{may not} copy text from the Lispref into docstrings in the\ncode.  And you @emph{may not} copy text from the GNU Emacs Lisp\nReference to the XEmacs Lisp Reference Manual.  (In this case it is at\nleast trivial to ask permission, although it is rather unclear whether\nit would be granted.)\n\nIn fact, parts of this document were derived by copying from XEmacs code\nunder the GPL, without any further permission from the authors.  Thus,\nthis document must be distributed under the GPL, as a ``volume''\nseparate from the XEmacs documentation under the XDL.  Note that the\n``mere aggregation'' clauses allow us to distribute in the same\ntarball.  But incorporating it as a node in the Lispref is prohibited,\neven if done by inclusion.\n\nA bit of advocacy:\n\nIf you look carefully at the additional restrictions imposed by the\nsoi-disant \"free\" documentation licenses, you discover that they are\nsimply proprietary restrictions guaranteeing a certain amount of\n@emph{unpaid} political advertising to the Free Software Foundation and\nGNU Project (and in the case of the FDL, this is extended to commercial\nadvertising by authors of original or derived works).  Whether this is\n``ethically justified'' or not is a difficult question.  What is certain\nis that there is little social benefit to these terms (since the license\ndocuments themselves contain the advocacy and must be included with any\ndistribution).\n\nI conclude it makes sense for XEmacs to reduce its restrictions, where\npossible, to the ``least common denominator,'' the GNU General Public\nLicense","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"da615f2f-cc36-4565-8551-1675a8973426"}
