{"license":"Python >= 2.0.1","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\r\n==========================\r\n\r\ncontextlib2 is a derivative of the contextlib module distributed by the PSF\r\nas part of the Python standard library. According, it is itself redistributed\r\nunder the PSF license (reproduced in full below). As the contextlib module\r\nwas added only in Python 2.5, the licenses for earlier Python versions are\r\nnot applicable and have not been included.\r\n\r\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\r\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http:\/\/www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\r\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\r\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\r\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http:\/\/www.cnri.reston.va.us)\r\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\r\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\r\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\r\nCorporation, see http:\/\/www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\r\nFoundation (PSF, see http:\/\/www.python.org\/psf\/) was formed, a\r\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\r\nIntellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of\r\nthe PSF.\r\n\r\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http:\/\/www.opensource.org for\r\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\r\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\r\nthe various releases that included the contextlib module.\r\n\r\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\r\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.
