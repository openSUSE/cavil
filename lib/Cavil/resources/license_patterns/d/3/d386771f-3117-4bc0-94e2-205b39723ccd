You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). \n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found","risk":1,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"d386771f-3117-4bc0-94e2-205b39723ccd"}
