The thread behind\n[4] contains statements on the issue made by Debian people; for more\ncontext also see the other mails in that thread.\nIn short -  the CDDL has extra restrictions, which the GPL does not\nallow.  Jörg has a different opinion about this and has repeatedly\nstated that the CDDL is not incompatible, interpreting a facial\nexpression in the above-mentioned video, calling us liars and generally\nappearing unwilling to consider our concerns (he never replied to the\nparts where we explained why it is incompatible). As he has basically\nignored what we have said, we have no choice but to fork. While the CDDL\n*may* be a free license, we never questioned if it is free or not, as it\nis not our place to decide this as the Debian cdrtools\nmaintainers. However, having been approved by OSI doesn't mean it's ok\nfor any usage, as Jörg unfortunately seems to assume. There are several\nOSI-approved licenses that are GPL-incompatible and CDDL is one of\nthem. That is and always was our point.\n\n\nFor our fork we used the last GPL-licensed version of the program code\nfrom Cdrtools [5] and killed the incompatibly licensed build system. It\nis now replaced by a cmake system, and the whole source we distribute\nshould be free of other incompatibilities, as to the best of our current\nknowledge","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"db7a79f4-0905-4571-b28e-edc843e1f30d"}
