Adding\nsupport for all these formats should not be done at the application level, as\nthen it needs to be written for each application separately. Licensing issues\nwith the decompressors will then also become a problem as just cut and pasting\nfrom one application to another is bound to hit license incompatibilities.\n\nSo clearly this belongs in a library, and in a library with a license which\nallows this code to be used from as many different applications as possible.\nHence libv4l was born.\n\n\nQ: Under which license may I use and distribute libv4l?\nA: The libv4l libraries are licensed under the GNU Library General Publishing\nLicense version 2 or (at your option) any later version.
