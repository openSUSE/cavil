By contrast, the\r\nGNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make\r\nsure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software\r\nFoundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\r\nprograms, too. \r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed\r\nto make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you\r\nwish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. \r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to\r\nsurrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\r\nsoftware, or if you modify it. \r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\r\nall the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must\r\nshow them these terms so they know their rights. \r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you\r\nlegal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software. \r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no\r\nwarranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients\r\nto know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the\r\noriginal authors' reputations. \r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\r\nredistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\r\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\r\nall. \r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. \r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND\r\nMODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder\r\nsaying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any\r\nsuch program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work\r\nunder copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with\r\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the\r\nterm \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its\r\nscope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its\r\ncontents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does. \r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,\r\nprovided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\r\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and\r\ngive any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. \r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty\r\nprotection in exchange for a fee. \r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the\r\nProgram, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that\r\nyou also meet all of these conditions: \r\n\r\n       a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the\r\n       date of any change. \r\n\r\n       b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived\r\n       from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\r\n       terms of this License. \r\n\r\n       c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when\r\n       started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\r\n       including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you\r\n       provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the\r\n       user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\r\n       normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an\r\n       announcement.) \r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived\r\nfrom the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this\r\nLicense, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\r\nmust be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\r\neach and every part regardless of who wrote it. \r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;\r\nrather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the\r\nProgram. \r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based\r\non the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope\r\nof this License. \r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable\r\nform under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: \r\n\r\n       a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\r\n       distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\r\n       interchange; or, \r\n\r\n       b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no\r\n       more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\r\n       corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n       customarily used for software interchange; or, \r\n\r\n       c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.\r\n       (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\r\n       object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) \r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an\r\nexecutable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as\r\na special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\r\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which\r\nthe executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. \r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\r\noffering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,\r\neven though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. \r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this\r\nLicense. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\r\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from\r\nyou under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. \r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you\r\npermission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you\r\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\r\ndistributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. \r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\r\nreceives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and\r\nconditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. \r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not\r\nlimited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\r\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,\r\nthen as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\r\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\r\nProgram. \r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the\r\nsection is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to\r\ncontest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\r\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous\r\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of\r\nthat system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other\r\nsystem and a licensee cannot impose that choice. \r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. \r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted\r\ninterfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\r\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\r\nLicense. \r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the General Public License from\r\ntime to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\r\nnew problems or concerns. \r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License\r\nwhich applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\r\nversion number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. \r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are\r\ndifferent, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\r\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be\r\nguided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the\r\nsharing and reuse of software generally. \r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\r\nPROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\r\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\r\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\r\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\r\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\r\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. \r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\r\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE\r\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\r\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\r\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH\r\nHOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to\r\nachieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. \r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to\r\nmost effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\r\npointer to where the full notice is found. \r\n\r\none line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) yyyy  name of author\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\r\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\r\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\nGNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\nalong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\r\nFoundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. \r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: \r\n\r\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\r\ntype `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\r\nto redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' \r\nfor details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public\r\nLicense. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could\r\neven be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. \r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright\r\ndisclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: \r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\r\ninterest in the program `Gnomovision'\r\n(which makes passes at compilers) written \r\nby James Hacker.\r\n\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.
