You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"d0b902c7-4858-43d8-91f6-21d753aa2462"}
