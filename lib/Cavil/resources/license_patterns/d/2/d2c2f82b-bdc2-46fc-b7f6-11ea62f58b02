This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our *\n# * interpretation of derived works with some common examples.  Our         *\n# * interpretation applies only to Nmap--we don't speak for other people's  *\n# * GPL works.                                                              *\n# *                                                                         *\n# * If you have any questions about the GPL licensing restrictions on using *\n# * Nmap in non-GPL works, we would be happy to help.  As mentioned above,  *\n# * we also offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary    *\n# * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *\n# * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *\n# * as providing for priority support and updates as well as helping to     *\n# * fund the continued development of Nmap technology.
