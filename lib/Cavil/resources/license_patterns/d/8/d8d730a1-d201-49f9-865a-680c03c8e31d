Termination.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\\n\"\n  \"provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\\n\"\n  \"modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\\n\"\n  \"this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\\n\"\n  \"paragraph of section 11).\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\\n\"\n  \"license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\\n\"\n  \"provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\\n\"\n  \"finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\\n\"\n  \"holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\\n\"\n  \"prior to 60 days after the cessation.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\\n\"\n  \"reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\\n\"\n  \"violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\\n\"\n  \"received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\\n\"\n  \"copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\\n\"\n  \"your receipt of the notice.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\\n\"\n  \"licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\\n\"\n  \"this License.

Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\\n\"\n  \"run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\\n\"\n  \"occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\\n\"\n  \"to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\\n\"\n  \"nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\\n\"\n  \"modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\\n\"\n  \"not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\\n\"\n  \"covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\\n\"\n  \"receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\\n\"\n  \"propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\\n\"\n  \"for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  An \\\"entity transaction\\\" is a transaction transferring control of an\\n\"\n  \"organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\\n\"\n  \"organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\\n\"\n  \"work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\\n\"\n  \"transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\\n\"\n  \"licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\\n\"\n  \"give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\\n\"\n  \"Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\\n\"\n  \"the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\\n\"\n  \"rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\\n\"\n  \"not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\\n\"\n  \"rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\\n\"\n  \"(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\\n\"\n  \"any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\\n\"\n  \"sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  11. Patents.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  A \\\"contributor\\\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\\n\"\n  \"License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\\n\"\n  \"work thus licensed is called the contributor's \\\"contributor version\\\".\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  A contributor's \\\"essential patent claims\\\" are all patent claims\\n\"\n  \"owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\\n\"\n  \"hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\\n\"\n  \"by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\\n\"\n  \"but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\\n\"\n  \"consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\\n\"\n  \"purposes of this definition, \\\"control\\\" includes the right to grant\\n\"\n  \"patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\\n\"\n  \"this License.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\\n\"\n  \"patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\\n\"\n  \"make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\\n\"\n  \"propagate the contents of its contributor version.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  In the following three paragraphs, a \\\"patent license\\\" is any express\\n\"\n  \"agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\\n\"\n  \"(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\\n\"\n  \"sue for patent infringement).  To \\\"grant\\\" such a patent license to a\\n\"\n  \"party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\\n\"\n  \"patent against the party.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\\n\"\n  \"and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\\n\"\n  \"to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\\n\"\n  \"publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\\n\"\n  \"then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\\n\"\n  \"available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\\n\"\n  \"patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\\n\"\n  \"consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\\n\"\n  \"license to downstream recipients.  \\\"Knowingly relying\\\" means you have\\n\"\n  \"actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\\n\"\n  \"covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\\n\"\n  \"in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\\n\"\n  \"country that you have reason to believe are valid.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\\n\"\n  \"arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\\n\"\n  \"covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\\n\"\n  \"receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\\n\"\n  \"or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\\n\"\n  \"you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\\n\"\n  \"work and works based on it.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  A patent license is \\\"discriminatory\\\" if it does not include within\\n\"\n  \"the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\\n\"\n  \"conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\\n\"\n  \"specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\\n\"\n  \"work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\\n\"\n  \"in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\\n\"\n  \"to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\\n\"\n  \"the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\\n\"\n  \"parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\\n\"\n  \"patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\\n\"\n  \"conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\\n\"\n  \"for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\\n\"\n  \"contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\\n\"\n  \"or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\\n\"\n  \"any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\\n\"\n  \"otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\\n\"\n  \"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\\n\"\n  \"excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\\n\"\n  \"covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\\n\"\n  \"License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\\n\"\n  \"not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\\n\"\n  \"to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\\n\"\n  \"the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\\n\"\n  \"License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\\n\"\n  \"Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users\\n\"\n  \"interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\\n\"\n  \"supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\\n\"\n  \"Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\\n\"\n  \"from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\\n\"\n  \"means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\\n\"\n  \"shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\\n\"\n  \"of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\\n\"\n  \"following paragraph.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\\n\"\n  \"permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\\n\"\n  \"under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\\n\"\n  \"combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\\n\"\n  \"License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\\n\"\n  \"but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\\n\"\n  \"3 of the GNU General Public License.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  14. Revised Versions of this License.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\\n\"\n  \"the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\\n\"\n  \"will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\\n\"\n  \"address new problems or concerns.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\\n\"\n  \"Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\\n\"\n  \"Public License \\\"or any later version\\\" applies to it, you have the\\n\"\n  \"option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\\n\"\n  \"version or of any later version published by the Free Software\\n\"\n  \"Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\\n\"\n  \"GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\\n\"\n  \"by the Free Software Foundation.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\\n\"\n  \"versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\\n\"\n  \"public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\\n\"\n  \"to choose that version for the Program.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  Later license versions may give you additional or different\\n\"\n  \"permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\\n\"\n  \"author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\\n\"\n  \"later version.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\\n\"\n  \"APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\\n\"\n  \"HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \\\"AS IS\\\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\\n\"\n  \"OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\\n\"\n  \"THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\n\"\n  \"PURPOSE.

SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\\n\"\n  \"ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  16. Limitation of Liability.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\\n\"\n  \"WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND\/OR CONVEYS\\n\"\n  \"THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\\n\"\n  \"GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\\n\"\n  \"USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\\n\"\n  \"DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\\n\"\n  \"PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\\n\"\n  \"EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\\n\"\n  \"SUCH DAMAGES.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\\n\"\n  \"above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\\n\"\n  \"reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\\n\"\n  \"an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\\n\"\n  \"Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\\n\"\n  \"copy of the Program in return for a fee.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\\n\"\n  \"possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\\n\"\n  \"free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\\n\"\n  \"to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\\n\"\n  \"state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\\n\"\n  \"the \\\"copyright\\\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\\n\"\n  \"    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or modify\\n\"\n  \"    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\\n\"\n  \"    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\\n\"\n  \"    (at your option) any later version.\\n\"\n  \"\\n\"\n  \"    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\\n\"\n  \"    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\\n\"\n  \"    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
