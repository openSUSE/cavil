It is\r\n+ numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\r\n+\r\n+\t\t\t    Preamble\r\n+\r\n+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\r\n+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\n+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\r\n+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n+\r\n+  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\r\n+specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\r\n+other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\r\n+your libraries, too.\r\n+\r\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\n+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\n+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\n+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n+\r\n+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\n+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\n+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\r\n+you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\r\n+\r\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\r\n+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\r\n+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\r\n+code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\r\n+complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\r\n+with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\r\n+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n+\r\n+  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\r\n+the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\r\n+permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n+\r\n+  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\r\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\n+library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\n+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\r\n+version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\r\n+the original authors' reputations.\r\n+\f\r\n+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\n+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\r\n+software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\r\n+transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\r\n+we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\r\n+free use or not licensed at all.\r\n+\r\n+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\r\n+GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\r\n+license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\r\n+designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\r\n+one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\r\n+the same as in the ordinary license.\r\n+\r\n+  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\r\n+they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\r\n+program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\r\n+changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\r\n+analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\r\n+a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\r\n+derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\r\n+treats it as such.\r\n+\r\n+  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\r\n+Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\r\n+sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\r\n+concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\r\n+\r\n+  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\r\n+users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\r\n+libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\r\n+permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\r\n+preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\r\n+libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\r\n+this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\r\n+changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\r\n+will lead to faster development of free libraries.\r\n+\r\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\n+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\r\n+\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\r\n+former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\r\n+works together with the library.\r\n+\r\n+  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\r\n+General Public License rather than by this special one.\r\n+\f\r\n+\t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n+\r\n+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\r\n+contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\r\n+party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\r\n+General Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\r\n+addressed as \"you\".\r\n+\r\n+  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\r\n+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n+\r\n+  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\r\n+which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\r\n+Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\r\n+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\r\n+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\r\n+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\r\n+included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n+\r\n+  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\n+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\r\n+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\n+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\r\n+and installation of the library.\r\n+\r\n+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\n+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\r\n+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\r\n+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\r\n+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\r\n+and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n+  \r\n+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\r\n+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\r\n+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\r\n+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\r\n+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\r\n+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\r\n+Library.\r\n+\r\n+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\r\n+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\r\n+fee.\r\n+\f\r\n+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\r\n+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\r\n+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\n+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n+\r\n+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n+\r\n+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\r\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n+\r\n+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\n+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n+\r\n+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\r\n+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\r\n+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\r\n+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\r\n+    in the event an application does not supply such function or\r\n+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\r\n+    its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n+\r\n+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\r\n+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\n+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\r\n+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\r\n+    root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n+\r\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\n+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\n+it.\r\n+\r\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n+collective works based on the Library.\r\n+\r\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\n+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\r\n+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\n+the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\n+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\r\n+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\r\n+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\n+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\n+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\n+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\r\n+these notices.\r\n+\f\r\n+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\r\n+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\n+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n+\r\n+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\r\n+the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n+\r\n+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\r\n+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\r\n+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\r\n+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\r\n+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\r\n+medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n+\r\n+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\r\n+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\r\n+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\r\n+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\r\n+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n+\r\n+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\n+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\r\n+linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\r\n+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\r\n+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\r\n+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\r\n+contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\r\n+library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\r\n+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n+\r\n+  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\r\n+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\n+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\n+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\r\n+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\r\n+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n+\r\n+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\n+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\r\n+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\r\n+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\r\n+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\r\n+Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n+\r\n+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\n+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\r\n+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\r\n+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n+\f\r\n+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\r\n+link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\r\n+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\r\n+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\r\n+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\r\n+engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n+\r\n+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\n+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\n+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\r\n+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\r\n+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\r\n+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\r\n+of these things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\n+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\r\n+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\r\n+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\r\n+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\r\n+    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\r\n+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\n+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\r\n+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\r\n+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\r\n+    to use the modified definitions.)\r\n+\r\n+    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\r\n+    least three years, to give the same user the materials\r\n+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\r\n+    than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n+\r\n+    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\r\n+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\r\n+    specified materials from the same place.\r\n+\r\n+    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\n+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n+\r\n+  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\r\n+Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\r\n+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\r\n+the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\r\n+distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\n+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\n+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\n+the executable.\r\n+\r\n+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\n+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\n+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\r\n+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\r\n+distribute.\r\n+\f\r\n+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\n+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\r\n+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\r\n+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\r\n+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\r\n+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\r\n+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\r\n+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\r\n+    Sections above.\r\n+\r\n+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\r\n+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\r\n+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n+\r\n+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\r\n+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\r\n+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\r\n+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\r\n+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\r\n+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\n+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n+\r\n+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\n+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\n+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\n+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\n+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\n+the Library or works based on it.\r\n+\r\n+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\n+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\n+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\n+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\n+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\n+this License.\r\n+\f\r\n+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\n+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\n+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\r\n+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\r\n+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\n+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n+\r\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\n+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\r\n+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n+\r\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\n+integrity of the free software distribution system which is\r\n+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\n+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\n+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\n+system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\n+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\n+impose that choice.\r\n+\r\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\n+be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\n+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\r\n+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\n+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\n+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\n+written in the body of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\r\n+versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\r\n+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\n+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n+\r\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\r\n+\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\n+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\r\n+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.\r\n+\f\r\n+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\n+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\n+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\r\n+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\r\n+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\r\n+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\r\n+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\n+and reuse of software generally.\r\n+\r\n+\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\r\n+\r\n+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\n+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\r\n+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\r\n+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\n+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\n+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\r\n+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n+\r\n+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\n+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\n+AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\r\n+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\r\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\r\n+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\n+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\n+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\r\n+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\n+DAMAGES.\r\n+\r\n+\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n+\f\r\n+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n+\r\n+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\n+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\r\n+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\r\n+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\r\n+ordinary General Public License).\r\n+\r\n+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\r\n+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\n+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n+\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n+\r\n+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n+\r\n+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\n+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\r\n+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\n+    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n+\r\n+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You\r\n+can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\r\n+this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\r\n+strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n+\r\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\r\n+not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\r\n+you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\r\n+for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\r\n+it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\r\n+it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\r\n+these things.\r\n+\r\n+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\n+distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\r\n+rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\r\n+you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n+\r\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\r\n+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\r\n+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\r\n+code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\r\n+complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\r\n+with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\r\n+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n+\r\n+  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\r\n+library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\r\n+permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n+\r\n+  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\r\n+there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\r\n+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\r\n+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\r\n+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\r\n+introduced by others.\r\n+\r\n+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\r\n+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\r\n+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\r\n+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\r\n+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\r\n+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\r\n+\r\n+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\r\n+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\r\n+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\r\n+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\r\n+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\r\n+libraries into non-free programs.\r\n+\r\n+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\r\n+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\r\n+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\r\n+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\r\n+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\r\n+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\r\n+the library.\r\n+\r\n+  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\r\n+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\r\n+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\r\n+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\r\n+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\r\n+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\r\n+special circumstances.\r\n+\r\n+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\r\n+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\r\n+a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\r\n+allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\r\n+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\r\n+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\r\n+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n+\r\n+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\r\n+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\r\n+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\r\n+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\r\n+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\r\n+system.\r\n+\r\n+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\r\n+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\r\n+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\r\n+that program using a modified version of the Library.\r\n+\r\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\n+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\r\n+\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\r\n+former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\r\n+be combined with the library in order to run.\r\n+\r\n+\t\t  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n+\r\n+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\r\n+program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\r\n+other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\r\n+this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\r\n+Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n+\r\n+  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\r\n+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n+\r\n+  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\r\n+which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\r\n+Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\r\n+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\r\n+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\r\n+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\r\n+included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n+\r\n+  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\n+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\r\n+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\n+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\r\n+and installation of the library.\r\n+\r\n+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\n+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\r\n+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\r\n+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\r\n+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\r\n+and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n+  \r\n+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\r\n+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\r\n+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\r\n+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\r\n+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\r\n+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\r\n+Library.\r\n+\r\n+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\r\n+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\r\n+fee.\r\n+\r\n+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\r\n+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\r\n+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\n+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n+\r\n+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n+\r\n+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\r\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n+\r\n+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\n+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n+\r\n+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\r\n+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\r\n+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\r\n+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\r\n+    in the event an application does not supply such function or\r\n+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\r\n+    its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n+\r\n+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\r\n+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\n+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\r\n+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\r\n+    root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n+\r\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\n+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\n+it.\r\n+\r\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n+collective works based on the Library.\r\n+\r\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\n+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\r\n+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\n+the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\n+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\r\n+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\r\n+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\n+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\n+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\n+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\r\n+these notices.\r\n+\r\n+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\r\n+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\n+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n+\r\n+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\r\n+the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n+\r\n+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\r\n+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\r\n+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\r\n+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\r\n+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\r\n+medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n+\r\n+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\r\n+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\r\n+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\r\n+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\r\n+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n+\r\n+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\n+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\r\n+linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\r\n+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\r\n+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\r\n+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\r\n+contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\r\n+library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\r\n+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n+\r\n+  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\r\n+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\n+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\n+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\r\n+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\r\n+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n+\r\n+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\n+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\r\n+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\r\n+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\r\n+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\r\n+Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n+\r\n+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\n+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\r\n+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\r\n+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n+\r\n+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\r\n+link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\r\n+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\r\n+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\r\n+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\r\n+engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n+\r\n+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\n+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\n+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\r\n+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\r\n+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\r\n+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\r\n+of these things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\n+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\r\n+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\r\n+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\r\n+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\r\n+    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\r\n+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\n+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\r\n+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\r\n+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\r\n+    to use the modified definitions.)\r\n+\r\n+    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\n+    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\r\n+    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\r\n+    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\r\n+    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\r\n+    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\r\n+    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\n+\r\n+    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\r\n+    least three years, to give the same user the materials\r\n+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\r\n+    than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n+\r\n+    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\r\n+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\r\n+    specified materials from the same place.\r\n+\r\n+    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\n+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n+\r\n+  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\r\n+Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\r\n+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\r\n+the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\r\n+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\n+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\n+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\n+the executable.\r\n+\r\n+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\n+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\n+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\r\n+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\r\n+distribute.\r\n+\r\n+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\n+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\r\n+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\r\n+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\r\n+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\r\n+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\r\n+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\r\n+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\r\n+    Sections above.\r\n+\r\n+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\r\n+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\r\n+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n+\r\n+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\r\n+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\r\n+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\r\n+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\r\n+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\r\n+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\n+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n+\r\n+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\n+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\n+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\n+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\n+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\n+the Library or works based on it.\r\n+\r\n+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\n+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\n+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\n+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\n+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\r\n+this License.\r\n+\r\n+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\n+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\n+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\r\n+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\r\n+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\n+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n+\r\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\n+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\r\n+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n+\r\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\n+integrity of the free software distribution system which is\r\n+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\n+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\n+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\n+system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\n+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\n+impose that choice.\r\n+\r\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\n+be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\n+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\r\n+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\n+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\n+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\n+written in the body of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\r\n+versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\r\n+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\n+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n+\r\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\r\n+\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\n+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\r\n+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.\r\n+\r\n+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\n+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\n+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\r\n+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\r\n+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\r\n+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\r\n+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\n+and reuse of software generally.\r\n+\r\n+\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\r\n+\r\n+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\n+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\r\n+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\r\n+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\n+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\n+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\r\n+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n+\r\n+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\n+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\n+AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\r\n+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\r\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\r\n+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\n+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\n+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\r\n+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\n+DAMAGES.\r\n+\r\n+\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n+\t\t     \r\n+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n+\r\n+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\n+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\r\n+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\r\n+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\r\n+ordinary General Public License).\r\n+\r\n+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.

New Versions.\r\n+      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and\/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\r\n+\r\n+      4.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n+      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\r\n+\r\n+      4.3. Modified Versions.\r\n+      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\r\n+\r\n+5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n+\r\n+   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN .AS IS. BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n+\r\n+6. TERMINATION.\r\n+\r\n+      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n+\r\n+      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as .Participant.) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\r\n+\r\n+      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\r\n+\r\n+7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n+\r\n+   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY.S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n+\r\n+8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n+\r\n+   The Covered Software is a .commercial item,. as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of .commercial computer software. (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ? 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and .commercial computer software documentation. as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\r\n+\r\n+9. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n+\r\n+   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction.s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys. fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\r\n+\r\n+10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n+\r\n+   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n+\r\n+   NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\r\n+\r\n+   The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions).

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n+\r\n+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n+\r\n+To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n+\r\n+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n+\r\n+We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n+\r\n+Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n+\r\n+Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n+\r\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n+\r\n+\r\n+TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n+\r\n+0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n+\r\n+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n+\r\n+1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n+\r\n+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n+\r\n+2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n+\r\n+   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n+\r\n+   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n+\r\n+   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n+\r\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n+\r\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\n+\r\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n+\r\n+   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n+\r\n+   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n+\r\n+   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n+\r\n+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n+\r\n+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n+\r\n+4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n+\r\n+5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\r\n+\r\n+6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n+\r\n+7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n+\r\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n+\r\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n+\r\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n+\r\n+8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n+\r\n+9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n+\r\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n+\r\n+10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n+\r\n+NO WARRANTY\r\n+\r\n+11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n+\r\n+12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n+\r\n+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n+\r\n+\r\n+How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n+\r\n+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n+\r\n+To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n+\r\n+   One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\r\n+\r\n+   Copyright (C)\r\n+\r\n+   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n+\r\n+   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n+\r\n+   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\r\n+\r\n+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n+\r\n+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n+\r\n+   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\n+   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n+\r\n+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n+\r\n+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n+\r\n+   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\n+\r\n+   signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\n+   Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n+\r\n+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.\r\n+\r\n+\r\n+\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2\r\n+\r\n+Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words\r\n+\r\n+\"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code.\"\r\n+\r\n+Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.\r\n+\r\n+As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module.? An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.? If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so.? If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.\r\n--- opa-fmgui-orig\/licenses\/jfreechart_license.txt\t1969-12-31 19:00:00.000000000 -0500\r\n+++ opa-fmgui-orig\/licenses\/jfreechart_license.txt\t2016-07-19 11:03:02.245817938 -0400\r\n@@ -0,0 +1,504 @@ \r\n+\t\t  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n+\t\t       Version 2.1, February 1999\r\n+\r\n+ Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n+     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\r\n+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\n+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n+\r\n+[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\r\n+ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\r\n+ the version number 2.1.]\r\n+\r\n+\t\t\t    Preamble\r\n+\r\n+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\r\n+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\n+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\r\n+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n+\r\n+  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\r\n+specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\r\n+Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\r\n+can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\r\n+this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\r\n+strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n+\r\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\r\n+not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\r\n+you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\r\n+for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\r\n+it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\r\n+it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\r\n+these things.\r\n+\r\n+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\n+distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\r\n+rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\r\n+you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n+\r\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\r\n+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\r\n+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\r\n+code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\r\n+complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\r\n+with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\r\n+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n+\r\n+  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\r\n+library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\r\n+permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n+\r\n+  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\r\n+there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\r\n+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\r\n+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\r\n+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\r\n+introduced by others.\r\n+\f\r\n+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\r\n+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\r\n+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\r\n+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\r\n+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\r\n+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\r\n+\r\n+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\r\n+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\r\n+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\r\n+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\r\n+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\r\n+libraries into non-free programs.\r\n+\r\n+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\r\n+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\r\n+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\r\n+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\r\n+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\r\n+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\r\n+the library.\r\n+\r\n+  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\r\n+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\r\n+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\r\n+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\r\n+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\r\n+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\r\n+special circumstances.\r\n+\r\n+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\r\n+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\r\n+a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\r\n+allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\r\n+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\r\n+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\r\n+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n+\r\n+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\r\n+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\r\n+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\r\n+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\r\n+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\r\n+system.\r\n+\r\n+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\r\n+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\r\n+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\r\n+that program using a modified version of the Library.\r\n+\r\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\n+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\r\n+\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\r\n+former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\r\n+be combined with the library in order to run.\r\n+\f\r\n+\t\t  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n+\r\n+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\r\n+program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\r\n+other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\r\n+this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\r\n+Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n+\r\n+  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\r\n+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n+\r\n+  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\r\n+which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\r\n+Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\r\n+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\r\n+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\r\n+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\r\n+included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n+\r\n+  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\n+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\r\n+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\n+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\r\n+and installation of the library.\r\n+\r\n+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\n+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\r\n+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\r\n+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\r\n+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\r\n+and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n+  \r\n+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\r\n+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\r\n+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\r\n+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\r\n+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\r\n+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\r\n+Library.\r\n+\r\n+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\r\n+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\r\n+fee.\r\n+\f\r\n+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\r\n+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\r\n+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\n+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n+\r\n+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n+\r\n+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\r\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n+\r\n+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\n+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n+\r\n+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\r\n+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\r\n+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\r\n+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\r\n+    in the event an application does not supply such function or\r\n+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\r\n+    its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n+\r\n+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\r\n+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\n+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\r\n+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\r\n+    root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n+\r\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\n+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\n+it.\r\n+\r\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n+collective works based on the Library.\r\n+\r\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\n+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\r\n+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\n+the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\n+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\r\n+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\r\n+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\n+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\n+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\n+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\r\n+these notices.\r\n+\f\r\n+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\r\n+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\n+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n+\r\n+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\r\n+the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n+\r\n+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\r\n+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\r\n+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\r\n+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\r\n+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\r\n+medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n+\r\n+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\r\n+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\r\n+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\r\n+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\r\n+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n+\r\n+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\n+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\r\n+linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\r\n+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\r\n+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\r\n+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\r\n+contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\r\n+library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\r\n+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n+\r\n+  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\r\n+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\n+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\n+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\r\n+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\r\n+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n+\r\n+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\n+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\r\n+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\r\n+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\r\n+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\r\n+Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n+\r\n+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\n+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\r\n+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\r\n+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n+\f\r\n+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\r\n+link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\r\n+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\r\n+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\r\n+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\r\n+engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n+\r\n+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\n+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\n+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\r\n+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\r\n+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\r\n+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\r\n+of these things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\n+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\r\n+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\r\n+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\r\n+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\r\n+    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\r\n+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\n+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\r\n+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\r\n+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\r\n+    to use the modified definitions.)\r\n+\r\n+    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\n+    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\r\n+    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\r\n+    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\r\n+    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\r\n+    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\r\n+    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\n+\r\n+    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\r\n+    least three years, to give the same user the materials\r\n+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\r\n+    than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n+\r\n+    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\r\n+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\r\n+    specified materials from the same place.\r\n+\r\n+    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\n+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n+\r\n+  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\r\n+Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\r\n+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\r\n+the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\r\n+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\n+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\n+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\n+the executable.\r\n+\r\n+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\n+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\n+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\r\n+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\r\n+distribute.\r\n+\f\r\n+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\n+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\r\n+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\r\n+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\r\n+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\r\n+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\r\n+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\r\n+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\r\n+    Sections above.\r\n+\r\n+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\r\n+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\r\n+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n+\r\n+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\r\n+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\r\n+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\r\n+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\r\n+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\r\n+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\n+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n+\r\n+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\n+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\n+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\n+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\n+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\n+the Library or works based on it.\r\n+\r\n+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\n+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\n+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\n+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\n+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\r\n+this License.\r\n+\f\r\n+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\n+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\n+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\r\n+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\r\n+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\n+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n+\r\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\n+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\r\n+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n+\r\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\n+integrity of the free software distribution system which is\r\n+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\n+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\n+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\n+system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\n+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\n+impose that choice.\r\n+\r\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\n+be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\n+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\r\n+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\n+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\n+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\n+written in the body of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\r\n+versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\r\n+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\n+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n+\r\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\r\n+\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\n+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\r\n+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.\r\n+\f\r\n+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\n+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\n+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\r\n+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\r\n+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\r\n+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\r\n+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\n+and reuse of software generally.\r\n+\r\n+\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\r\n+\r\n+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\n+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\r\n+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\r\n+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\n+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\n+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\r\n+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n+\r\n+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\n+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\n+AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\r\n+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\r\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\r\n+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\n+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\n+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\r\n+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\n+DAMAGES.\r\n+\r\n+\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n+\f\r\n+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n+\r\n+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\n+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\r\n+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\r\n+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\r\n+ordinary General Public License).\r\n+\r\n+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\r\n+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\n+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n+\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n+\r\n+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n+\r\n+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\n+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\n+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\n+    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n+\r\n+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\r\n+ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\r\n+ the version number 2.1.]\r\n+\r\n+                            Preamble\r\n+\r\n+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\r\n+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\n+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\r\n+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n+\r\n+  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\r\n+specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\r\n+Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\r\n+can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\r\n+this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\r\n+strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n+\r\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\r\n+not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\r\n+you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\r\n+for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\r\n+it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\r\n+it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\r\n+these things.\r\n+\r\n+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\n+distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\r\n+rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\r\n+you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n+\r\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\r\n+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\r\n+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\r\n+code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\r\n+complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\r\n+with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\r\n+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n+\r\n+  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\r\n+library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\r\n+permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n+\r\n+  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\r\n+there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\r\n+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\r\n+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\r\n+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\r\n+introduced by others.\r\n+\f\r\n+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\r\n+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\r\n+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\r\n+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\r\n+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\r\n+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\r\n+\r\n+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\r\n+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\r\n+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\r\n+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\r\n+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\r\n+libraries into non-free programs.\r\n+\r\n+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\r\n+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\r\n+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\r\n+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\r\n+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\r\n+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\r\n+the library.\r\n+\r\n+  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\r\n+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\r\n+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\r\n+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\r\n+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\r\n+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\r\n+special circumstances.\r\n+\r\n+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\r\n+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\r\n+a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\r\n+allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\r\n+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\r\n+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\r\n+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n+\r\n+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\r\n+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\r\n+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\r\n+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\r\n+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\r\n+system.\r\n+\r\n+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\r\n+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\r\n+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\r\n+that program using a modified version of the Library.\r\n+\r\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\n+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\r\n+\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\r\n+former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\r\n+be combined with the library in order to run.\r\n+\f\r\n+                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n+\r\n+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\r\n+program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\r\n+other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\r\n+this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\r\n+Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n+\r\n+  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\r\n+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n+\r\n+  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\r\n+which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\r\n+Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\r\n+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\r\n+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\r\n+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\r\n+included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n+\r\n+  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\n+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\r\n+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\n+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\r\n+and installation of the library.\r\n+\r\n+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\n+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\r\n+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\r\n+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\r\n+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\r\n+and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n+\r\n+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\r\n+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\r\n+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\r\n+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\r\n+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\r\n+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\r\n+Library.\r\n+\r\n+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\r\n+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\r\n+fee.\r\n+\f\r\n+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\r\n+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\r\n+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\n+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n+\r\n+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n+\r\n+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\r\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n+\r\n+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\n+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n+\r\n+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\r\n+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\r\n+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\r\n+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\r\n+    in the event an application does not supply such function or\r\n+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\r\n+    its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n+\r\n+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\r\n+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\n+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\r\n+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\r\n+    root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n+\r\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\n+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\n+it.\r\n+\r\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n+collective works based on the Library.\r\n+\r\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\n+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\r\n+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\n+the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\n+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\r\n+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\r\n+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\n+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\n+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\n+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\r\n+these notices.\r\n+\f\r\n+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\r\n+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\n+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n+\r\n+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\r\n+the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n+\r\n+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\r\n+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\r\n+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\r\n+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\r\n+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\r\n+medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n+\r\n+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\r\n+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\r\n+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\r\n+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\r\n+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n+\r\n+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\n+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\r\n+linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\r\n+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\r\n+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\r\n+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\r\n+contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\r\n+library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\r\n+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n+\r\n+  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\r\n+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\n+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\n+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\r\n+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\r\n+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n+\r\n+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\n+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\r\n+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\r\n+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\r\n+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\r\n+Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n+\r\n+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\n+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\r\n+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\r\n+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n+\f\r\n+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\r\n+link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\r\n+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\r\n+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\r\n+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\r\n+engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n+\r\n+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\n+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\n+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\r\n+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\r\n+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\r\n+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\r\n+of these things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\n+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\r\n+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\r\n+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\r\n+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\r\n+    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\r\n+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\n+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\r\n+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\r\n+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\r\n+    to use the modified definitions.)\r\n+\r\n+    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\n+    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\r\n+    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\r\n+    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\r\n+    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\r\n+    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\r\n+    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\n+\r\n+    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\r\n+    least three years, to give the same user the materials\r\n+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\r\n+    than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n+\r\n+    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\r\n+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\r\n+    specified materials from the same place.\r\n+\r\n+    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\n+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n+\r\n+  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\r\n+Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\r\n+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\r\n+the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\r\n+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\n+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\n+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\n+the executable.\r\n+\r\n+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\n+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\n+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\r\n+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\r\n+distribute.\r\n+\f\r\n+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\n+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\r\n+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\r\n+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\r\n+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\r\n+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n+\r\n+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\r\n+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\r\n+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\r\n+    Sections above.\r\n+\r\n+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\r\n+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\r\n+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n+\r\n+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\r\n+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\r\n+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\r\n+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\r\n+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\r\n+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\n+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n+\r\n+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\n+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\n+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\n+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\n+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\n+the Library or works based on it.\r\n+\r\n+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\n+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\n+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\n+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\n+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\n+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\r\n+this License.\r\n+\f\r\n+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\n+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\n+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\r\n+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\r\n+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\n+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n+\r\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\n+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\r\n+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n+\r\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\n+integrity of the free software distribution system which is\r\n+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\n+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\n+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\n+system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\n+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\n+impose that choice.\r\n+\r\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\n+be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\n+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\r\n+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\n+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\n+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\n+written in the body of this License.\r\n+\r\n+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\r\n+versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\r\n+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\n+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n+\r\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\r\n+\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\n+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\r\n+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\r\n+the Free Software Foundation.\r\n+\f\r\n+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\n+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\n+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\r\n+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\r\n+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\r\n+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\r\n+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\n+and reuse of software generally.\r\n+\r\n+                            NO WARRANTY\r\n+\r\n+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\n+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\r\n+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\r\n+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\n+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\n+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\r\n+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n+\r\n+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\n+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\n+AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\r\n+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\r\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\r\n+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\n+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\n+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\r\n+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\n+DAMAGES.\r\n+\r\n+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n+\f\r\n+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n+\r\n+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\n+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\r\n+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\r\n+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\r\n+ordinary General Public License).\r\n+\r\n+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\r\n+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\n+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n+\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n+\r\n+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n+\r\n+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\n+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\n+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\n+    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n+\r\n+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
