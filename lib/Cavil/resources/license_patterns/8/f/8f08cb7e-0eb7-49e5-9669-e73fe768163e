PREAMBLE<\/Para>\n\n    <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,\n    or other written document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\n    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\n    with or without modifying it, either commercially or\n    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the\n    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not\n    being considered responsible for modifications made by\n    others.<\/para>\n\n    <para>This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that\n    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the\n    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which\n    is a copyleft license designed for free software.<\/para>\n\n    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals\n    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:\n    a free program should come with manuals providing the same\n    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited\n    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,\n    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a\n    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works\n    whose purpose is instruction or reference.<\/para>\n\n    <Para>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<\/Para>\n\n    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that\n    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\n    distributed under the terms of this License.  The \"Document\",\n    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the\n    public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\".<\/para>\n\n    <para>A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work\n    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied\n    verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another\n    language.<\/para>\n\n    <para>A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter\n    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the\n    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the\n    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains\n    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.\n    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of\n    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)\n    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with\n    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\n    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\n    them.<\/para>\n\n    <para>The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections\n    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,\n    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this\n    License.<\/para>\n\n    <para>The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that\n    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the\n    notice that says that the Document is released under this\n    License.<\/para>\n\n    <para>A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a\n    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification\n    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed\n    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text\n    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs\n    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that\n    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic\n    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text\n    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\n    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent\n    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not\n    \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".<\/para>\n\n    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include\n    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input\n    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and\n    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.\n    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that\n    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML\n    or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally\n    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word\n    processors for output purposes only.<\/para>\n\n    <para>The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page\n    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,\n    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.\n    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,\n    \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of\n    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the\n    text.<\/para>\n\n    <Para>2. VERBATIM COPYING<\/Para>\n\n    <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,\n    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this\n    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this\n    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and\n    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this\n    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or\n    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or\n    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for\n    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you\n    must also follow the conditions in section 3.<\/para>\n\n    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated\n    above, and you may publicly display copies.<\/para>\n\n    <Para>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<\/Para>\n\n    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more\n    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,\n    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and\n    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front\n    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must\n    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these\n    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all\n    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add\n    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes\n    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the\n    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim\n    copying in other respects.<\/para>\n\n    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to\n    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\n    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto\n    adjacent pages.<\/para>\n\n    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\n    numbering more than 100, you must either include a\n    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or\n    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible\n    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy\n    of the Document, free of added material, which the general\n    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\n    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the\n    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you\n    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that\n    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\n    location until at least one year after the last time you\n    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or\n    retailers) of that edition to the public.<\/para>\n\n    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the\n    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large\n    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"8f08cb7e-0eb7-49e5-9669-e73fe768163e"}
