License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\n   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\n   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\n   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n       Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n       Collections; and,\n    b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as\n       incorporated in Collections.\n    c. For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those\n            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through\n            any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,\n            the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such\n            royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under\n            this License;\n        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n            compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives\n            the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise\n            by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\n            collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that\n            the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\n            administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,\n            from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this\n            License.\n .\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\n   known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\n   such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\n   in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make\n   Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted\n   by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\n   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the\n       terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform\n       Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the\n       Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or\n       impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this\n       License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the\n       rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.\n       You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices\n       that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with\n       every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You\n       Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any\n       effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the\n       ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights\n       granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This\n       Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection,\n       but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself\n       to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a\n       Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n       practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by\n       Section 4(b), as requested.\n    b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You\n       must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep\n       intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable\n       to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the\n       Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or\n       if the Original Author and\/or Licensor designate another party or\n       parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n       attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\n       terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such\n       party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to\n       the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n       specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n       refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the\n       Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented\n       in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a\n       Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for\n       all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of\n       these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits\n       for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You\n       may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of\n       attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your\n       rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly\n       assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by\n       the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties, as\n       appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,\n       express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor\n       and\/or Attribution Parties.\n    c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n       otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute\n       or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n       Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other\n       derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n       prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\n .\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\n   OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\n   KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\n   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\n   LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\n   ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\n   THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO\n   YOU.\n .\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\n   LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\n   ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n   ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR\n   HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n   7. Termination\n    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n       Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You\n       under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n       terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n       compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n       survive any termination of this License.\n    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\n       is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the\n       Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to\n       release the Work under different license terms or to stop\n       distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such\n       election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other\n       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the\n       terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\n       force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n .\n   8. Miscellaneous\n    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\n       Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\n       Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\n       under this License.\n    b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\n       of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\n       action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\n       reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision\n       valid and enforceable.\n    c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n       breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n       writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\n       consent.\n    d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n       with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\n       understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the\n       Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\n       additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\n       You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n       agreement of the Licensor and You.\n    e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in\n       this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne\n       Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\n       amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the\n       WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\n       Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised\n       on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in\n       the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to\n       be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the\n       implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable\n       national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under\n       applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted\n       under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be\n       included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict","risk":4,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"88703629-45f6-4108-9202-72832d4c654d"}
