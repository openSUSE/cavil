Contact the Spyder team to ensure the usage is justified and compatible.\r\n\r\n#. Add the files, preserving any original copyright\/legal\/attribution header\r\n\r\n#. If making non-trivial modifications, copy the standard Spyder copyright\r\n   header from ``.ciocopyright`` to just below the original headers;\r\n   if the original headers are unformatted and just consist of a copyright\r\n   statement and perhaps mention of the license, incorporate them verbatim\r\n   within the Spyder header where appropriate.\r\n   Always ensure copyright statements are in ascending chronological order,\r\n   and replace the year in the Spyder copyright statement with the current one.\r\n   Modify the license location to be the current directory, or NOTICE.txt.\r\n\r\n#. Include the following line at the end of each module's docstring,\r\n   separated by blank lines:\r\n\r\n   ```rst\r\n   Adapted from path\/to\/file\/in\/original\/repo.py of the\r\n   `Project Name <url-to-original-github-repo>`_.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   For example,\r\n\r\n   ```rst\r\n   Adapted from qcrash\/_dialogs\/gh_login.py of the\r\n   `QCrash Project <https:\/\/github.com\/ColinDuquesnoy\/QCrash>`_.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n#. Convert the files to project standards where needed.\r\n\r\n#. If the copied file(s) reside in a directory dedicated to them, place the\r\n   source project's LICENSE.txt file there, and any other legal files.\r\n   Also, mention the same in the __init__.py file in that directory.\r\n\r\n#. Add an entry in NOTICE.txt with the instructions and template there.\r\n\r\n#. If a non-code visible asset (icons, fonts, animations, etc) or otherwise\r\n   under a Creative Commons license, include a mention in the appropriate\r\n   section of the README, as well as Spyder's About dialog, in the same form","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"88628729-bdf0-42a6-be13-a546056f28be"}
