{"license":"GPL-2.0+","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The GNU Public License, Version 2\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,\nthe gnu General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to\nmake sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\nSoftware Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other\nFree Software Foundation software is covered by the gnu Library General Public License instead.) You can\napply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses\nare designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the\nsoftware or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask\nyou to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\ncopies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\nrecipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which\ngives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that\nthere is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors’ reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger\nthat redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use\nor not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\n94\n\n\f9.2.2\n\nTerms and Conditions For Copying, Distribution and Modification\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\nholder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The “Program”,\nbelow, refers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the Program” means either the\nProgram or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program\nor a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.) Each licensee is\naddressed as “you”.\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are\noutside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been\nmade by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any\nmedium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and\nto the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer\nwarranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on\nthe Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n(a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files\nand the date of any change.\n(b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is\nderived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n(c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it,\nwhen started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty\n(or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based\non the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are\nnot derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them\nas separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions\nfor other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely\nby you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective\nworks based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a\nwork based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other\nwork under the scope of this License.\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code\nor executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\ninterchange; or,\n95\n\n\f(b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a\ncharge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machinereadable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n(c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source\ncode. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\nthe program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsubsection\nb above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For\nan executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus\nany associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of\nthe executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything\nthat is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\nkernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,\nthen offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\nthe source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object\ncode.\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under\nthis License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void,\nand will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else\ngrants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions\nare prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\nProgram (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on\nit.\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise\nof the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this\nLicense.\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\n(not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions\nof this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program\nat all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program\nby all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy\nboth it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the\nbalance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\nor to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of\nthe free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people\nhave made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in\nreliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is\nwilling to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of\nthis License.\n96\n\n\f8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by\ncopyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\nadd an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is\npermitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\nlimitation as if written in the body of this License.\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the General Public License\nfrom time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of\nthis License which applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\nare different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n9.2.3\n\nNo Warranty\n\n10. Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the program, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and\/or\nother parties provide the program “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,\nincluding, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular\npurpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. Should the\nprogram prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.\n11. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or\nany other party who may modify and\/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to\nyou for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the\nuse or inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered\ninaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any\nother programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"823b4ea3-7e68-4cdc-a73d-38826964784c"}
