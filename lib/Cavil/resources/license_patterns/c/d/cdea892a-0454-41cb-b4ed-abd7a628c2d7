Storer's work on limited lookahead as explicated in his\r\ntext \"Data Compression (methods and theory)\", Computer Science Press, 1988,\r\nand the various patents pending associated with the Fiala and Greene\r\nCACM article of April, 1989 on textual substitution methods","risk":1,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"cdea892a-0454-41cb-b4ed-abd7a628c2d7"}
