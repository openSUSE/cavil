Additional Definitions.\n       As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of  the  GNU  Lesser\n       General  Public  License,  and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the\n       GNU General Public License.\n\n       \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,  other\n       than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n       An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by\n       the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.  Defining\n       a  subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using\n       an interface provided by the Library.\n\n       A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an  Appli-\n       cation  with  the  Library.  The particular version of the Library with\n       which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked Version\".\n\n       The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the Corre-\n       sponding  Source  for  the Combined Work, excluding any source code for\n       portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are  based\n       on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n       The  \"Corresponding  Application  Code\"  for  a Combined Work means the\n       object code and\/or source code for the Application, including any  data\n       and  utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\n       Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n       You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4  of  this  License\n       without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n       If  you  modify  a  copy  of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\n       facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an  Application\n       that  uses  the  facility  (other  than  as an argument passed when the\n       facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the  modified  ver-\n       sion:\n\n       a)  under  this  License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n           ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the  func-\n           tion  or  data,  the facility still operates, and performs whatever\n           part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n       b)  under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of  this\n           License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n       The  object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a\n       header file that is part of the Library.  You may  convey  such  object\n       code  under  terms  of  your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\n       material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts\n       and  accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or\n       fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n       a)  Give prominent notice with each copy of the object  code  that  the\n           Library  is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered\n           by this License.\n\n       b)  Accompany the object code with a copy  of  the  GNU  GPL  and  this\n           license document.\n\n4. Combined Works.\n       You  may  convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken\n       together, effectively do not restrict modification of the  portions  of\n       the  Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for\n       debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\n       a)  Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that  the\n           Library  is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered\n           by this License.\n\n       b)  Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the  GNU  GPL  and  this\n           license document.\n\n       c)  For  a  Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execu-\n           tion, include the copyright notice  for  the  Library  among  these\n           notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of\n           the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n       d)\n           Do one of the following:\n\n           0)  Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n               License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suit-\n               able for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or\n               relink  the  Application  with a modified version of the Linked\n               Version to produce a modified  Combined  Work,  in  the  manner\n               specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Correspond-\n               ing Source.\n\n           1)  Use a suitable shared library mechanism for  linking  with  the\n               Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n               a copy of the Library already present on  the  user's  computer\n               system,  and  (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n               of the Library that is  interface-compatible  with  the  Linked\n               Version.\n\n       e)  Provide  Installation  Information, but only if you would otherwise\n           be required to provide such information under section 6 of the  GNU\n           GPL,  and  only to the extent that such information is necessary to\n           install and execute a modified version of the  Combined  Work  pro-\n           duced  by  recombining or relinking the Application with a modified\n           version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the  Instal-\n           lation  Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source\n           and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must\n           provide  the  Installation  Information  in the manner specified by\n           section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\n       You may place library facilities that are a work based on  the  Library\n       side by side in a single library together with other library facilities\n       that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and con-\n       vey  such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both\n       of the following:\n\n       a)  Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same  work  based\n           on  the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, con-\n           veyed under the terms of this License.\n\n       b)  Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it  is\n           a  work  based  on  the  Library,  and explaining where to find the\n           accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n       The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\n       the  GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new ver-\n       sions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may  differ\n       in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n       Each  version  is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\n       as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\n       Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you\n       have the option of following the terms and conditions  either  of  that\n       published  version  or of any later version published by the Free Soft-\n       ware Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not  specify  a\n       version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose\n       any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published  by\n       the Free Software Foundation.\n\n       If  the  Library  as  you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\n       whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License  shall\n       apply,  that  proxy's  public statement of acceptance of any version is\n       permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"cd5f1e2f-5a4e-42ca-9476-f1fca34e04ce"}
