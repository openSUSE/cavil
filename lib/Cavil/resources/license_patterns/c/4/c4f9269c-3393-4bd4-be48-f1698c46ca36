By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\r\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software\r\n--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General\r\nPublic License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's\r\nsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\r\n(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU\r\nLesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\r\nprograms, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\r\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\r\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\r\nservice if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\r\nto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\r\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\r\n or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\r\nhave. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\r\ncode. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\r\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\r\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent\r\nmust be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\r\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another\r\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\r\nthe Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\r\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\r\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\r\nis true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\r\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\r\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\r\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\r\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\r\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\r\nProgram.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\r\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\r\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\r\nthat you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\n    parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\n    License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\r\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the\r\n    Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\r\nstorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\r\nscope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\r\n    interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\r\n    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n    to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is\r\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\r\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\r\ncompilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\r\nexception, the source code distributed need not include anything that\r\nis normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the\r\nmajor components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system\r\non which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\nthe executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\r\nto copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to\r\ncopy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the\r\nsource code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the\r\nsource along with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\r\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\r\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\r\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License\r\nwill not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\r\nin full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\r\non the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\r\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license\r\nwould not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all\r\nthose who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\r\nonly way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\r\nentirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\r\nadd an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\r\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\r\nnot thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation\r\nas if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail\r\nto address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\r\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\r\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\r\nwe sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by\r\nthe two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our\r\nfree software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\r\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\r\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\r\nYOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\r\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\r\nMODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE\r\nTO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\r\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\r\nPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF\r\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\nDAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS","risk":3,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"c4f9269c-3393-4bd4-be48-f1698c46ca36"}
