The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim\r\n   that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a\r\n   product, you are requested to acknowledge its use in the product\r\n   documentation, along with details on where to get an unmodified version of\r\n   this software, but this is not a strict requirement.\r\n\r\n   [Note that the above point asks for a link to DUMB, not just a mention.\r\n   Googling for DUMB doesn't help much! The URL is \"http:\/\/dumb.sf.net\/\".]\r\n\r\n   [The link was originally strictly required. This was changed for two\r\n   reasons. Firstly, if many projects request an acknowledgement, the list of\r\n   acknowledgements can become quite unmanageable. Secondly, DUMB was placing\r\n   a restriction on the code using it, preventing people from using the GNU\r\n   General Public Licence which disallows any such restrictions. See\r\n   http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/philosophy\/bsd.html for more information on this\r\n   subject. However, if DUMB plays a significant part in your project, we do\r\n   urge you to acknowledge its use.]\r\n\r\n2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be\r\n   misrepresented as being the original software.\r\n\r\n3. This notice may not be removed from or altered in any source distribution.\r\n\r\n4. If you are using the Program in someone else's bedroom on any Monday at\r\n   3:05 pm, you are not allowed to modify the Program for ten minutes. [This\r\n   clause provided by Inphernic; every licence should contain at least one\r\n   clause, the reasoning behind which is far from obvious.]\r\n\r\n5. Users who wish to use DUMB for the specific purpose of playing music are\r\n   required to feed their dog on every full moon (if deemed appropriate).\r\n   [This clause provided by Allefant, who couldn't remember what Inphernic's\r\n   clause was.]\r\n\r\n6. No clause in this licence shall prevent this software from being depended\r\n   upon by a product licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. If such a\r\n   clause is deemed to exist, Debian, then it shall be respected in spirit as\r\n   far as possible and all other clauses shall continue to apply in full\r\n   force.\r\n\r\n8. Take the number stated as introducing this clause. Multiply it by two,\r\n   then subtract four. Now insert a '+' between the two digits and evaluate\r\n   the resulting sum. Call the result 'x'. If you have not yet concluded that\r\n   every numbered clause in this licence whose ordinal number is strictly\r\n   greater than 'x' (with the exception of the present clause) is null and\r\n   void, Debian, then you are hereby informed that laughter is good for one's\r\n   health and you are warmly suggested to do it. By the way, Clauses 4, 5 and\r\n   6 are null and void. Incidentally, I like Kubuntu. The work you guys do is\r\n   awesome.
