If\n     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the\n     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate\n     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply\n     to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But\n     when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\n     work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on\n     the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\n     extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part\n     regardless of who wrote it.\n\n     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\n     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the\n     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\n     derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n\n     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\n     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a\n     volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other\n     work under the scope of this License.\n\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To\n     do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,\n     so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,\n     version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than\n     version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared,\n     then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not\n     make any other change in these notices.\n\n     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to\n     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the\n     Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative\n     of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the\n     terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with\n     the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must\n     be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n     medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n     the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled\n     or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such\n     a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n     therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n     However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because\n     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses\n     the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n     Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n     When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header\n     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may\n     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is\n     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work\n     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a\n     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely\n     defined by law.\n\n     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a\n     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus\n     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section\n     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself","risk":1,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"c405406f-6d61-4f13-869f-4d33aa92eb2f"}
