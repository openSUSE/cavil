PREAMBLE\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense \r\nof freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either \r\ncommercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit \r\nfor their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\r\n\r\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the \r\nsame sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\r\n\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: \r\na free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not \r\nlimited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published \r\nas a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n\r\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder \r\nsaying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, \r\nunlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such \r\nmanual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, \r\nmodify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\r\n\r\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, \r\nor with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the \r\nrelationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) \r\nand contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook \r\nof mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical \r\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position \r\nregarding them.\r\n\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, \r\nin the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition \r\nof Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. \r\nIf the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the \r\nnotice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a \r\nBack-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\r\n\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available \r\nto the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for \r\nimages composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is \r\nsuitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text \r\nformatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged \r\nto thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if \r\nused for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX \r\ninput format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed \r\nfor human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary \r\nformats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing \r\ntools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors \r\nfor output purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, \r\nlegibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any \r\ntitle page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the \r\nbeginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in \r\nparentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned \r\nbelow, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section \r\nwhen you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\r\n\r\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. \r\nThese Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming \r\nwarranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning \r\nof this License.\r\n\r\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, \r\nthe copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, \r\nand that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct \r\nor control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation \r\nin exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section \r\n3.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\r\n\r\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n\r\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more \r\nthan 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, \r\nclearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. \r\nBoth covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present \r\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in \r\naddition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy \r\nthese conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many \r\nas fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable \r\nTransparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from \r\nwhich the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent \r\ncopy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, \r\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible \r\nat the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through \r\nyour agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large \r\nnumber of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n\r\n4. MODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided \r\nthat you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the \r\nDocument, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In \r\naddition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\n    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those \r\nof previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use \r\nthe same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\n    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications \r\nin the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal \r\nauthors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\r\n    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\r\n    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\n    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\r\n    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified \r\nVersion under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\n    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's \r\nlicense notice.\r\n    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\n    I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, \r\nyear, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \r\n\"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its \r\nTitle Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\n    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, \r\nand likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed \r\nin the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the \r\nDocument itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\n    K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve \r\nin the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.\r\n    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers \r\nor the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\r\n    M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\r\n    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant \r\nSection.\r\n    O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain \r\nno material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To \r\ndo this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must \r\nbe distinct from any other section titles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version \r\nby various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as \r\nthe authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, \r\nto the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover \r\nText may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text \r\nfor the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you \r\nmay not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added \r\nthe old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity \r\nfor or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 \r\nabove for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the \r\noriginal documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, \r\nand that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced \r\nwith a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title \r\nof each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher \r\nof that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant \r\nSections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one \r\nsection Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\r\n\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements.\"\r\n\r\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the \r\nindividual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided \r\nthat you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided \r\nyou insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding \r\nverbatim copying of that document.\r\n\r\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a \r\nvolume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation \r\nis not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document \r\nis included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves \r\nderivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less \r\nthan one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document \r\nwithin the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must \r\nappear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\r\n\r\n8. TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms \r\nof section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, \r\nbut you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant \r\nSections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty \r\nDisclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of \r\nthose notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License \r\nor a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\r\n\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) \r\nto Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\r\n\r\n9. TERMINATION\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. \r\nAny other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your \r\nrights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not \r\nhave their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. \r\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems \r\nor concerns. See https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered \r\nversion of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions \r\neither of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software \r\nFoundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published \r\n(not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"ca542c46-44c6-4106-adf1-f4963f8635e5"}
