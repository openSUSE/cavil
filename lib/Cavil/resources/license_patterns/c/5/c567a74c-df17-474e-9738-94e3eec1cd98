The URL is \"http:\/\/dumb.sf.net\/\".]\n\n   [The link was originally strictly required. This was changed for two\n   reasons. Firstly, if many projects request an acknowledgement, the list of\n   acknowledgements can become quite unmanageable. Secondly, DUMB was placing\n   a restriction on the code using it, preventing people from using the GNU\n   General Public Licence which disallows any such restrictions. See\n   http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/philosophy\/bsd.html for more information on this\n   subject. However, if DUMB plays a significant part in your project, we do\n   urge you to acknowledge its use.]\n\n2.

Users who wish to use DUMB for the specific purpose of playing music are\n   required to feed their dog on every full moon (if deemed appropriate).\n   [This clause provided by Allefant, who couldn't remember what Inphernic's\n   clause was.]\n\n6.
