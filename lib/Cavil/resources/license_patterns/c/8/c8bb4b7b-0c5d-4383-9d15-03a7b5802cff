This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.

You can apply it to your programs, too.\\n\"\n                \"When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\\n\"\n                \"To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
