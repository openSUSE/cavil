{"license":"GFDL-1.1","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nwritten document ``free'' in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone\nthe effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\nmodifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,\nthis License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get\ncredit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\nmodifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n@sp 1\n@item\nAPPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work that contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\nunder the terms of this License.  The ``Document'', below, refers to any\nsuch manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\naddressed as ``you''.\n\nA ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\n\nA ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.\n\nThe ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.\n\nA ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\nsubsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is\nnot ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include\nPostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only\nby proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output\npurposes only.\n\nThe ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n@sp 1\n@item\nVERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"ced8e48a-d696-46f0-a499-7ff2eeb0e49d"}
