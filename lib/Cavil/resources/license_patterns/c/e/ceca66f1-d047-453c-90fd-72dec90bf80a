However, this mechanism was not\noptimized for modern computer systems, which is not surprising given\nthat these overheads were not so expensive in the mid-80s.  Nonetheless,\npassive serialization appears to be the first deferred-destruction\nmechanism to be used in production.  Furthermore, the relevant patent\nhas lapsed, so this approach may be used in non-GPL software, if desired.\n(In contrast, implementation of RCU is permitted only in software licensed\nunder either GPL or LGPL.
