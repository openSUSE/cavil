SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-SA-4.0\r\n\r\n==========\r\n Licenses\r\n==========\r\n\r\nTL;DR summary: The libcamera core is covered by the LGPL-2.1-or-later license.\r\nIPA modules included in libcamera are covered by a free software license.\r\nThird-parties may develop IPA modules outside of libcamera and distribute them\r\nunder a closed-source license, provided they do not include source code from\r\nthe libcamera project.\r\n\r\nThe libcamera project contains multiple libraries, applications and utilities.\r\nLicenses are expressed through SPDX tags in text-based files that support\r\ncomments, and through the .reuse\/dep5 file otherwise. A copy of all licenses is\r\nstored in the LICENSES directory.\r\n\r\nThe following text summarizes the licenses covering the different components of\r\nthe project to offer a quick overview for developers. The SPDX and DEP5\r\ninformation are however authoritative and shall prevail in case of\r\ninconsistencies with the text below.\r\n\r\nThe libcamera core source code, located under the include\/libcamera\/ and\r\nsrc\/libcamera\/ directories, is fully covered by the LGPL-2.1-or-later license,\r\nwhich thus covers distribution of the libcamera.so binary. Other files located\r\nin those directories, most notably the meson build files, and various related\r\nbuild scripts, may be covered by different licenses. None of their source code\r\nis incorporated in the in the libcamera.so binary, they thus don't affect the\r\ndistribution terms of the binary.\r\n\r\nThe IPA modules, located in src\/ipa\/, are covered by free software licenses\r\nchosen by the module authors. The LGPL-2.1-or-later license is recommended.\r\nThose modules are compiled as separate binaries and dynamically loaded by the\r\nlibcamera core at runtime.\r\n\r\nThe IPA module API is defined in headers located in include\/libcamera\/ipa\/ and\r\ncovered by the LGPL-2.1-or-later license. Using the data types (including\r\nclasses, structures and enumerations) and macros defined in the IPA module and\r\nlibcamera core API headers in IPA modules doesn't extend the LGPL license to\r\nthe IPA modules. Third-party closed-source IPA modules are thus permitted,\r\nprovided they comply with the licensing requirements of any software they\r\ninclude or link to.\r\n\r\nThe libcamera Android camera HAL component is located in src\/android\/. The\r\nlibcamera-specific source code is covered by the LGPL-2.1-or-later license. The\r\ncomponent additionally contains header files and source code, located\r\nrespectively in include\/android\/ and src\/android\/metadata\/, copied verbatim\r\nfrom Android and covered by the Apache-2.0 license.\r\n\r\nThe libcamera GStreamer and V4L2 adaptation source code, located respectively\r\nin src\/gstreamer\/ and src\/v4l2\/, is fully covered by the LGPL-2.1-or-later\r\nlicense. Those components are compiled to separate binaries and do not\r\ninfluence the license of the libcamera core.\r\n\r\nThe cam and qcam sample applications, as well as the unit tests, located\r\nrespectively in src\/cam\/, src\/qcam\/ and test\/, are covered by the\r\nGPL-2.0-or-later license. qcam additionally includes an icon set covered by the\r\nMIT license. Those applications are compiled to separate binaries and do not\r\ninfluence the license of the libcamera core.\r\n\r\nAdditional utilities are located in the utils\/ directory and are covered by\r\nvarious licenses. They are not part of the libcamera core and do not influence\r\nits license.\r\n\r\nFinally, copies of various Linux kernel headers are included in include\/linux\/\r\nto avoid depending on particular versions of those headers being installed in\r\nthe system. The Linux kernel headers are covered by their respective license,\r\nincluding the Linux kernel license syscall exception. Using a copy of those\r\nheaders doesn't affect libcamera licensing terms in any way compared to using\r\nthe same headers installed in the system from kernel headers packages provided\r\nby Linux distributions.\r\n","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"cfd5d250-b14e-40cc-af71-d7aa3edaa975"}
