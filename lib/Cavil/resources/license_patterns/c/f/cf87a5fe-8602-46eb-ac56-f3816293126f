Waivable Compulsory License Schemes.

The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\r\nmade subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\na. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\r\nof this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\r\nIdentifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\r\nDistribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on\r\nthe Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the\r\nrecipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient\r\nunder the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You\r\nmust keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the\r\ndisclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or\r\nPublicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You\r\nmay not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that\r\nrestrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the\r\nrights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This\r\nSection 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but\r\nthis does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be\r\nmade subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,\r\nupon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\r\nremove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nb. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You\r\nmust, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep\r\nintact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the\r\nmedium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author\r\n(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or if the Original Author\r\nand\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor\r\ninstitute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution\r\nParties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other\r\nreasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of\r\nthe Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the\r\nURI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,\r\nunless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\r\ninformation for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may\r\nbe implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the\r\ncase of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit\r\nfor all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of\r\nthese credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for\r\nthe other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\r\nuse the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\r\nin the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\r\nLicense, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\r\nconnection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\r\nLicensor and\/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use\r\nof the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of\r\nthe Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties.\r\n\r\nc. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\r\notherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\r\nPublicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\r\nCollections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other\r\nderogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to\r\nthe Original Author's honor or reputation.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\r\nOFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\r\nKIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\r\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\r\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\r\nWHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\r\nEXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\r\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\r\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\r\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\r\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\nautomatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\r\nIndividuals or entities who have received Collections from You under\r\nthis License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided\r\nsuch individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\r\nlicenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\r\nis perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\r\nNotwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\r\nWork under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\r\nany time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\r\nCollection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\r\non the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\nb. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\r\nby the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\r\nthe minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\r\nenforceable.\r\n\r\nc. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\r\nbreach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\r\nand signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\n\r\nd. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\r\nwith respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\r\nagreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\r\nhere. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\r\nappear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified\r\nwithout the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n\r\ne.

These\r\nrights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in\r\nwhich the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the\r\ncorresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty\r\nprovisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of\r\nrights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights\r\nnot granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be\r\nincluded in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\r\nlicense of any rights under applicable law.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Notice\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\r\nwhatsoever in connection with the Work.
