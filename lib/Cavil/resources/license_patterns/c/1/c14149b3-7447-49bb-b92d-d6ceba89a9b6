For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required\r\n    by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above\r\n    and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly\r\n    or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or\r\n    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties, as\r\n    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express\r\n    prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and\/or\r\n    Attribution Parties.\r\n d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\r\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\r\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or\r\n    Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other\r\n    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the\r\n    Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those\r\n    jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in\r\n    Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be\r\n    deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory\r\n    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the\r\n    Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the\r\n    fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to\r\n    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to\r\n    make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS\r\nTHE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND\r\nCONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,\r\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A\r\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\r\nACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.\r\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH\r\nEXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN\r\nNO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\r\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS\r\nLICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\r\n    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or\r\n    entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this\r\n    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such\r\n    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\r\n    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\r\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\r\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work\r\n    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\r\n    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this\r\n    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\r\n    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\r\n    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the\r\n    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms\r\n    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers\r\n    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and\r\n    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\r\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\r\n    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the\r\n    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\r\n    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\r\n    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed\r\n    by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\r\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements\r\n    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor\r\n    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any\r\n    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual\r\n    written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\r\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for\r\n    the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,\r\n    1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the\r\n    WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright\r\n    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter\r\n    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are\r\n    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the\r\n    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.\r\n    If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\r\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional\r\n    rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not\r\n    intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\r\n\r\n    Creative Commons Notice\r\n\r\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\r\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work.
