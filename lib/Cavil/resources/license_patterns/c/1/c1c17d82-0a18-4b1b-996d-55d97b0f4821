{"license":"LGPL-2.1+","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether\ngratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode. If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n<\/p>\n<p> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n<\/p>\n<p> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n<\/p>\n<p> Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence\nof\nany free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n<\/p>\n<p> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n<\/p>\n<p> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or\nusing\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n<\/p>\n<p> We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License. It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n<\/p>\n<p> For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes\na de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n<\/p>\n<p> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\nsystem.\n<\/p>\n<p> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of\nthe\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n<\/p>\n<p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n<\/p>\n<h4>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<\/h4>\n<p>\n<strong>0.<\/strong>\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n<\/p>\n<p> A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n<\/p>\n<p> The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n<\/p>\n<p> \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation\nand installation of the library.\n<\/p>\n<p> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\nnot\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.<\/strong>\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n<\/p>\n<p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.<\/strong>\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>a)<\/strong> The modified work must itself be a software\nlibrary.<\/li>\n  <li><strong>b)<\/strong> You must cause the files modified to carry\nprominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\nany change.<\/li>\n  <li><strong>c)<\/strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be\nlicensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\nLicense.<\/li>\n  <li><strong>d)<\/strong>\n    <p> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\ntable of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the\nfacility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\ninvoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the\nevent an application does not supply such function or table, the\nfacility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose\nremains meaningful. <\/p>\n    <p> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots\nhas a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\napplication. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\napplication-supplied function or table used by this function must be\noptional: if the application does not supply it, the square root\nfunction must still compute square roots.) <\/p>\n    <p> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit. <\/p>\n    <p> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\ncontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent\nis to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library. <\/p>\n    <p> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\nLibrary with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a\nvolume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other\nwork under\nthe scope of this License.<\/p>\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>3.<\/strong>\nYou may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n<\/p>\n<p> Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"c1c17d82-0a18-4b1b-996d-55d97b0f4821"}
