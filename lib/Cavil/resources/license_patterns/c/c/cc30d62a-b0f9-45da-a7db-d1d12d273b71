{"export_restricted":0,"license":"LGPL-2.1+","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.<\/strong>\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n<\/p>\n<p> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.<\/strong>\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n<\/p>\n<p> However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\". The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n<\/p>\n<p> When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header\nfile\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n<\/p>\n<p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n<\/p>\n<p> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.<\/strong>\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n<\/p>\n<p> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>a)<\/strong> Accompany the work with the complete\ncorresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including\nwhatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\nSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with\nthe Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the\nLibrary\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the user can\nmodify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable\ncontaining the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who\nchanges the contents of definitions files in the Library will not\nnecessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified\ndefinitions.)<\/li>\n  <li><strong>b)<\/strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for\nlinking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at\nrun time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer\nsystem, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and\n(2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\nthe user installs one, as long as the modified version is\ninterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<\/li>\n  <li><strong>c)<\/strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,\nvalid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials\nspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost\nof performing this distribution.<\/li>\n  <li><strong>d)<\/strong> If distribution of the work is made by\noffering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent\naccess to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<\/li>\n  <li><strong>e)<\/strong> Verify that the user has already received a\ncopy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n<\/p>\n<p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.<\/strong> You may place library facilities that are a work\nbased on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>a)<\/strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of\nthe same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\nfacilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections\nabove.<\/li>\n  <li><strong>b)<\/strong> Give prominent notice with the combined\nlibrary of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and\nexplaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same\nwork.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>8.<\/strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.<\/strong>\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.<\/strong>\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.<\/strong>\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.<\/strong>\nIf the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may\nadd\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.<\/strong>\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.<\/strong>\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>NO WARRANTY<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.<\/strong>\nBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.

You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of\nthe\nordinary General Public License).\n<\/p>\n<p> To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<pre><var>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.<\/var><br>Copyright (C) <var>year<\/var>  <var>name of author<\/var><br><br>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or<br>modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br><br>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
