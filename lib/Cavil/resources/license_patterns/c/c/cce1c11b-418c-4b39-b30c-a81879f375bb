{"license":"GFDL-1.2","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice\n     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These\n     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in\n     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\n     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and\n     has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n  2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\n     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\n     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\n     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License\n     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you\n     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You\n     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading\n     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,\n     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you\n     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the\n     conditions in section 3.\n\n     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,\n     and you may publicly display copies.\n\n  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly\n     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and\n     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must\n     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all\n     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and\n     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly\n     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The\n     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title\n     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the\n     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as\n     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these\n     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\n     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\n     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\n     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto\n     adjacent pages.\n\n     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\n     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable\n     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with\n     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general\n     network-using public has access to download using public-standard\n     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free\n     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take\n     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\n     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will\n     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or\n     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.2-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"cce1c11b-418c-4b39-b30c-a81879f375bb"}
