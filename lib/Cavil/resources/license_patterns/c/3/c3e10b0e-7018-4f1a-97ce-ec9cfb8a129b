Although\n    implemented as a template, which makes it possible to incorrectly use\n    \\Ref{TArray} with non-trivial classes, it should not be done.\n\n    A lot of things is shared by these three arrays. That is why there are\n    more base classes:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n       \\item \\Ref{ArrayBase} defines functions independent of the elements type\n       \\item \\Ref{ArrayBaseT} template class defining functions shared by\n             \\Ref{DArray} and \\Ref{TArray}\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    The main difference between \\Ref{GArray} (now obsolete) and these ones\n    is the copy-on-demand strategy, which allows you to copy array objects\n    without copying the real data. It's the same thing, which has been\n    implemented in \\Ref{GString} long ago: as long as you don't try to modify","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"c3e10b0e-7018-4f1a-97ce-ec9cfb8a129b"}
