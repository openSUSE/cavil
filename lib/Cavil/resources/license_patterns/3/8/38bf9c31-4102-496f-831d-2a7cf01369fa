ANY USE,\n             REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES\n             RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n             1. DEFINITIONS\n\n             \"Contribution\" means: \n\n                   a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the\n                   initial code and documentation distributed under\n                   this Agreement, and \n\n                   b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n                   i) changes to the Program, and\n                   ii) additions to the Program;\n\n                   where such changes and\/or additions to the Program\n                   originate from and are distributed by that\n                   particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\n                   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program\n                   by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such\n                   Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include\n                   additions to the Program which: (i) are separate\n                   modules of software distributed in conjunction with\n                   the Program under their own license agreement, and\n                   (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\n             \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes\n             the Program.\n\n             \"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a\n             Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or\n             sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the\n             Program. \n\n\n\n             \"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in\n             accordance with this Agreement.\n\n             \"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under\n             this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n\n\n\n             2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n\n                   a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each\n                   Contributor hereby grants Recipient a\n                   non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n                   license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,\n                   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and\n                   sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if\n                   any, and such derivative works, in source code and\n                   object code form.\n\n                   b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each\n                   Contributor hereby grants Recipient a\n                   non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n                   license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,\n                   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\n                   Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source\n                   code and object code form. This patent license\n                   shall apply to the combination of the Contribution\n                   and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n                   added by the Contributor, such addition of the\n                   Contribution causes such combination to be covered\n                   by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall\n                   not apply to any other combinations which include\n                   the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed\n                   hereunder.\n\n                   c) Recipient understands that although each\n                   Contributor grants the licenses to its\n                   Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n                   provided by any Contributor that the Program does\n                   not infringe the patent or other intellectual\n                   property rights of any other entity. Each\n                   Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient\n                   for claims brought by any other entity based on\n                   infringement of intellectual property rights or\n                   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights\n                   and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient\n                   hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any\n                   other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n\n                   For example, if a third party patent license is\n                   required to allow Recipient to distribute the\n                   Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\n                   acquire that license before distributing the\n                   Program.\n\n\n\n\n                   d) Each Contributor represents that to its\n                   knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its\n                   Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n                   license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n\n\n             3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n             A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in\n             object code form under its own license agreement, provided\n             that:\n                   a) it complies with the terms and conditions of\n                   this Agreement; and\n\n                   b) its license agreement:\n                   i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all\n                   Contributors all warranties and conditions, express\n                   and implied, including warranties or conditions of\n                   title and non-infringement, and implied warranties\n                   or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a\n                   particular purpose;\n\n                   ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all\n                   Contributors all liability for damages, including\n                   direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n                   consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n                   iii) states that any provisions which differ from\n                   this Agreement are offered by that Contributor\n                   alone and not by any other party; and\n\n                   iv) states that source code for the Program is\n                   available from such Contributor, and informs\n                   licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner\n                   on or through a medium customarily used for\n                   software exchange.\n\n\n             When the Program is made available in source code form:\n                   a) it must be made available under this Agreement;\n                   and\n                   b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with\n                   each copy of the Program. \n\n             Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices\n             contained within the Program.\n\n             Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of\n             its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably\n             allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of\n             the Contribution. \n\n\n             4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\n\n             Commercial distributors of software may accept certain\n             responsibilities with respect to end users, business\n             partners and the like. While this license is intended to\n             facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\n             Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial\n             product offering should do so in a manner which does not\n             create potential liability for other Contributors.\n             Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a\n             commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial\n             Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n             other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any\n             losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\n             from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a\n             third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\n             extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\n             Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\n             Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations\n             in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n             relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n             infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n             Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n             Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the\n             Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n             Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related\n             settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n             participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\n\n             For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a\n             commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor\n             is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial\n             Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\n             warranties related to Product X, those performance claims\n             and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's\n             responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial\n             Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n             Contributors related to those performance claims and\n             warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor\n             to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\n             must pay those damages.\n\n\n             5. NO WARRANTY\n\n             EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE\n             PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT\n             WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n             IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\n             CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR\n             FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\n             responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\n             and distributing the Program and assumes all risks\n             associated with its exercise of rights under this\n             Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and\n             costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,\n             damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\n             unavailability or interruption of operations. \n\n             6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n             EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER\n             RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY\n             FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,\n             OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n             LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n             LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT\n             (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT\n             OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE\n             OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n             POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n             7. GENERAL\n\n             If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or\n             unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect\n             the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\n             terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n             parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n             minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n             enforceable.\n\n\n             If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a\n             Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to\n             software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n             lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\n             Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall\n             terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\n             addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation\n             against any entity (including a cross-claim or\n             counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n             itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other\n             software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's\n             patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n             Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n             litigation is filed.\n\n             All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall\n             terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material\n             terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure\n             such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming\n             aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights\n             under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease\n             use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably\n             practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this\n             Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating\n             to the Program shall continue and survive. \n\n             Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of\n             this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the\n             Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the\n             following manner.
