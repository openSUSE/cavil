(You\r\n     will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the\r\n     computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\r\n-    \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though\r\n     there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that\r\n     recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they\r\n     received it.\r\n\r\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\r\nStandard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate\r\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\r\n\r\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from\r\nthe Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a\r\nway shall still be considered the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\r\nthat you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when\r\nyou changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise\r\n     make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications\r\n     to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on\r\n     a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the\r\n     Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard\r\n     Version of the Package.\r\n\r\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or\r\n     organization.\r\n\r\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not\r\n     conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided,\r\n     and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard\r\n     executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard\r\n     Version.\r\n\r\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable\r\nform, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library\r\n     files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)\r\n     on where to get the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\r\n     the Package with your modifications.\r\n\r\n     c) accompany any non-standard executables with their\r\n     corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the\r\n     non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\r\n     documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),\r\n     together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.\r\nYou may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not\r\ncharge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in\r\naggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger\r\n(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise\r\nthis Package as a product of your own.\r\n\r\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from\r\nthe programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this\r\nPackage, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold\r\ncommercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\r\n\r\n7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not\r\nbe considered part of this Package.\r\n\r\n8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted\r\nprovided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt\r\nis made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the\r\ncommercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of\r\nthis Package.\r\n\r\n9.
