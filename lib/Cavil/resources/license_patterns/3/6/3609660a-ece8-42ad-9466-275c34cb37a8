DEFINITIONS<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Contribution\" means:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial\r\ncode and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"list\">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"list\">i) changes to the Program, and<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"list\">ii) additions to the Program;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"list\">where such changes and\/or additions to the Program\r\noriginate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A\r\nContribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the\r\nProgram by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such\r\nContributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the\r\nProgram which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\r\nconjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)\r\nare not derivative works of the Program.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes\r\nthe Program.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a\r\nContributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its\r\nContribution alone or when combined with the Program.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance\r\nwith this Agreement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under\r\nthis Agreement, including all Contributors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each\r\nContributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\r\nroyalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works\r\nof, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the\r\nContribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in\r\nsource code and object code form.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each\r\nContributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\r\nroyalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,\r\noffer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such\r\nContributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent\r\nlicense shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\r\nProgram if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,\r\nsuch addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered\r\nby the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\r\ncombinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\r\nlicensed hereunder.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor\r\ngrants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances\r\nare provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\r\npatent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\r\nContributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\r\nany other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\r\nor otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\r\ngranted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to\r\nsecure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\r\nexample, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient\r\nto distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire\r\nthat license before distributing the Program.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it\r\nhas sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\r\nthe copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code\r\nform under its own license agreement, provided that:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this\r\nAgreement; and<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">b) its license agreement:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors\r\nall warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties\r\nor conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\r\nconditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors\r\nall liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\r\nincidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this\r\nAgreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\r\nparty; and<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">iv) states that source code for the Program is available\r\nfrom such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\r\nreasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software\r\nexchange.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"list\">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each\r\ncopy of the Program.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\r\nwithin the Program.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\r\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\r\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain\r\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\r\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of\r\nthe Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial\r\nproduct offering should do so in a manner which does not create\r\npotential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor\r\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\r\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and\r\nindemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\r\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\")\r\narising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\r\nparty against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\r\nacts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\r\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\r\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\r\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In\r\norder to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify\r\nthe Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the\r\nCommercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial\r\nContributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The\r\nIndemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own\r\nexpense.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\r\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\r\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\r\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\r\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\r\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\r\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\r\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\r\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\r\nmust pay those damages.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>5. NO WARRANTY<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\r\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\nANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\r\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\r\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\r\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\r\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to\r\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,\r\ndamage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or\r\ninterruption of operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT\r\nNOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\r\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\r\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\r\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\r\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\r\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>7. GENERAL<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\r\nby the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\r\nextent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\r\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other\r\nsoftware or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such\r\nRecipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the\r\ndate such litigation is filed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\r\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\r\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time\r\nafter becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights\r\nunder this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and\r\ndistribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,\r\nRecipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by\r\nRecipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this\r\nAgreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is\r\ncopyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The\r\nAgreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including\r\nrevisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the\r\nAgreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse\r\nFoundation is the initial Agreement Steward.

Each new version of the Agreement will be\r\ngiven a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\r\nContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\r\nAgreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version\r\nof the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the\r\nProgram (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as\r\nexpressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no\r\nrights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under\r\nthis Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or\r\notherwise.
