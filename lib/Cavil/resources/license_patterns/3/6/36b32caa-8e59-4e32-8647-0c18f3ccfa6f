We concluded it would be in the best interest of the\r\npmacct project to attempt to relicense all code under a more permissive\r\nBSD-style license, for mainly two reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Faced with our own mortality, it became clear that succession\r\n   planning is of paramount importance for this project's continued\r\n   success. We contemplated what happens in context of intellectual\r\n   property rights should one of pmacct's contributors pass away, and\r\n   realized potential heirs won't necessarily desire involvement in this\r\n   open source project, potentially hampering changes to intellectual\r\n   property policies in the project's future. \r\n\r\n2) We suspect there are entities who violate the terms of pmacct's\r\n   current GPL license, but at the same time we don't wish to litigate.\r\n   Instead of getting infringers to change their behavior, relicensing\r\n   the project could be another way to resolve the potential for\r\n   conflict: we see benefits to removing rules we don't plan on\r\n   enforcing anyway.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, the preferred license under which we encourge people to\r\ncontribute new work is a variant of the ISC license (also used by the\r\nOpenBSD project). The license template (to be used in file headers) can\r\nbe found here:\r\n\r\n    https:\/\/github.com\/pmacct\/pmacct\/blob\/master\/LICENSE.template\r\n\r\nWe need explicit approval from all contributors, and carefully keep\r\ntrack of those agreements.
