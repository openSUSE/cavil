{"license":"LGPL-2.1+","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute\n the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.  Any executables\n containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are\n linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a\n     \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work\n     containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under\n     terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of\n     the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for\n     debugging such modifications.\n\n You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library\n is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution\n displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the\n Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy\n of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\n  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n     source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the\n     work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if\n     the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete\n     machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and\/or\n     source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to\n     produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is\n     understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files\n     in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the\n     application to use the modified definitions.) b) Accompany the work\n     with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same\n     user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no\n     more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n  c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\n     designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\n     materials from the same place.\n\n  d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or\n     that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\"\n must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the\n executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code\n distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in\n either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,\n and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless\n that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\n It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of\n other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating\n system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library\n together in an executable that you distribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\n     side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities\n     not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,\n     provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the\n     Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and\n     provided that you do these two things:\n\n  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on\n     the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be\n     distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part\n     of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\n     Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\n     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\n     Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n     this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\n     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n     long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed\n     it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute\n     the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by\n     law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\n     distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you\n     indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms\n     and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or\n     works based on it.\n\n 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. \n     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n     this License.\n\n 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n     may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license\n     would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all\n     those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\n     only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\n     entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances\n\n It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents\n or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;\n this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free\n software distribution system which is implemented by public license\n practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range\n of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\n application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or\n she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a\n licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n 12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\n     countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\n     copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an\n     explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n     countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n     not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n     limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\n     the Library General Public License from time to time.  Such new\n     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version\n number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n Foundation","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"2dce52a5-c3b8-4640-8013-8333d7e87c94"}
