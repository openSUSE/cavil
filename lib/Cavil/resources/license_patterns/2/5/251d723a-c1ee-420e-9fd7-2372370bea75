The size of this fee is to be determined, in each instance,\n%%  by the commercial user, depending on his\/her judgment of the value of\n%%  multicol for his\/her product.\n%%\n%%\n%%  The conditions for this are as follows:\n%%\n%%   The producer of a proprietary and commercially market product\n%%   that involves typesetting using multicol is asked to determine\n%%   the value of a license fee for using multicol if\n%%\n%%   - the product is a document and the producer has decided to\n%%     include multicol to typeset (parts of) the document or has\n%%     directed the author of the document to include multicol (for\n%%     example, by providing a class file to be used by the author)\n%%\n%%   - the product is a LaTeX class or package that includes multicol\n%%\n%%\n%%   There is no moral obligation in case\n%%\n%%   - the product is a document but producer has not directed\n%%     the author to include multicol (in that case the moral obligation\n%%     lies with the author of the document)\n%%\n%%   - the product does not involve typesetting, e.g., consists, for\n%%     example, of distributing multicol and its documentation.\n%%\n%%   - the product is not proprietary, i.e., is made available as free\n%%     software itself (which doesn't prohibit its commercial marketing)\n%%\n%%   - multicol is used for non-commercial purposes\n%%\n%%\n%% Determinating a license fee might result in a license fee of zero\n%% (i.e., no payment) in case a producer has determined that the use\n%% of multicol has no enhancing effect on the product. This is a\n%% plausible scenario, i.e., in the above two cases the producer is\n%% only asked to evaluate the value of multicol for the product\n%% not for the payment of a license fee per se (which might or might\n%% not follow from this evaluation).\n%%\n%% The license fee, if any, can be payed either to the LaTeX3 fund\n%% (see ltx3info.txt in the base LaTeX distribution) or to the author of\n%% the program who can be contacted at","risk":4,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"251d723a-c1ee-420e-9fd7-2372370bea75"}
