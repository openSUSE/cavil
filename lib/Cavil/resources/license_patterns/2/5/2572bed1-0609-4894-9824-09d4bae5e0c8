By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This<br>\r\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>\r\nusing it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>\r\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br>\r\nyour programs, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>\r\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>\r\nyou have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>\r\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>\r\nrights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>\r\ndistribute and\/or modify the software.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>\r\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>\r\nauthors' reputations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>\r\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>\r\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>\r\nmodification follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>\r\n TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br>\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another<br>\r\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>\r\nthe term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>\r\nalong with the Program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>\r\n stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>\r\n whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>\r\n part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>\r\n parties under the terms of this License.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>\r\n when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>\r\n interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>\r\n announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>\r\n notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>\r\n a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>\r\n these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>\r\n License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>\r\n does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>\r\n the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>\r\ncollective works based on the Program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>\r\nthe scope of this License.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>\r\n source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>\r\n 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>\r\n years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>\r\n cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>\r\n machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>\r\n distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>\r\n customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>\r\n to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br>\r\n allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>\r\n received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>\r\n an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>\r\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br>\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br>\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>\r\nitself accompanies the executable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br>\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>\r\nparties remain in full compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>\r\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br>\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>\r\nthe Program or works based on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>\r\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>\r\nthis License.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<br>\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>\r\ncircumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>\r\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>\r\nsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>\r\nimpose that choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>\r\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br>\r\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions<br>\r\nof the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br>\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>\r\naddress new problems or concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br>\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>\r\nlater version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>\r\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>\r\nFoundation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>\r\nto ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>\r\nmake exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n NO WARRANTY<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<br>\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE<br>\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR<br>\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>\r\n<br>\r\n How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest<br>\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>\r\nthe &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>\r\n Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify<br>\r\n it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>\r\n the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>\r\n (at your option) any later version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>\r\n but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>\r\n MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the<br>\r\n GNU General Public License for more details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br>\r\n with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>\r\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>\r\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>\r\n Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>\r\n This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>\r\n under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>\r\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may<br>\r\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>\r\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>\r\nschool, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<br>\r\nnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>\r\n `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>\r\n Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>\r\nproprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>\r\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>\r\nlibrary. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>\r\nPublic License instead of this License.<br>\r\n<\/body>\r\n<\/html","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"2572bed1-0609-4894-9824-09d4bae5e0c8"}
