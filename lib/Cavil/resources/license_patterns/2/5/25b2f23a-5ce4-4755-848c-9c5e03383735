If you wish to embed Nmap      *\n * technology into proprietary software, we sell alternative licenses      *\n * (contact sales@insecure.com).  Dozens of software vendors already       *\n * license Nmap technology such as host discovery, port scanning, OS       *\n * detection, and version detection.                                       *\n *                                                                         *\n * Note that the GPL places important restrictions on \"derived works\", yet *\n * it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid       *\n * misunderstandings, we consider an application to constitute a           *\n * \"derivative work\" for the purpose of this license if it does any of the *\n * following:                                                              *\n * o Integrates source code from Nmap                                      *\n * o Reads or includes Nmap copyrighted data files, such as                *\n *   nmap-os-db or nmap-service-probes.                                    *\n * o Executes Nmap and parses the results (as opposed to typical shell or  *\n *   execution-menu apps, which simply display raw Nmap output and so are  *\n *   not derivative works.)                                                * \n * o Integrates\/includes\/aggregates Nmap into a proprietary executable     *\n *   installer, such as those produced by InstallShield.                   *\n * o Links to a library or executes a program that does any of the above   *\n *                                                                         *\n * The term \"Nmap\" should be taken to also include any portions or derived *\n * works of Nmap.  This list is not exclusive, but is just meant to        *\n * clarify our interpretation of derived works with some common examples.  *\n * These restrictions only apply when you actually redistribute Nmap.  For *\n * example, nothing stops you from writing and selling a proprietary       *\n * front-end to Nmap.  Just distribute it by itself, and point people to   *\n * http:\/\/nmap.org to download Nmap.                                       *\n *                                                                         *\n * We don't consider these to be added restrictions on top of the GPL, but *\n * just a clarification of how we interpret \"derived works\" as it applies  *\n * to our GPL-licensed Nmap product.  This is similar to the way Linus     *\n * Torvalds has announced his interpretation of how \"derived works\"        *\n * applies to Linux kernel modules.  Our interpretation refers only to     *\n * Nmap - we don't speak for any other GPL products.                       *\n *                                                                         *\n * If you have any questions about the GPL licensing restrictions on using *\n * Nmap in non-GPL works, we would be happy to help.  As mentioned above,  *\n * we also offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary    *\n * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *\n * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *\n * as providing for priority support and updates as well as helping to     *\n * fund the continued development of Nmap technology.  Please email        *\n * sales@insecure.com for further information.                             *\n *                                                                         *\n * As a special exception to the GPL terms, Insecure.Com LLC grants        *\n * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the     *\n * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that  *\n * listed in the included COPYING.OpenSSL file, and distribute linked      *\n * combinations including the two. You must obey the GNU GPL in all        *\n * respects for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.  If you modify    *\n * this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the file,   *\n * but you are not obligated to do so.                                     *\n *                                                                         *\n * If you received these files with a written license agreement or         *\n * contract stating terms other than the terms above, then that            *\n * alternative license agreement takes precedence over these comments.     *\n *                                                                         *\n * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     *\n * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. *\n * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes (none     *\n * have been found so far).                                                *\n *                                                                         *\n * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,    *\n * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes   *\n * to fyodor@insecure.org for possible incorporation into the main         *\n * distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the         *\n * Insecure.Org development mailing lists, it is assumed that you are      *\n * offering Fyodor and Insecure.Com LLC the unlimited, non-exclusive right *\n * to reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  Nmap will always be          *\n * available Open Source, but this is important because the inability to   *\n * relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software  *\n * projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also occasionally relicense the    *\n * code to third parties as discussed above.  If you wish to specify       *\n * special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you  *\n * send them.                                                              *\n *                                                                         *\n * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but     *\n * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of              *\n * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
