It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.\r\n     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR\r\n\r\n     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\n     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\r\n     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\r\n     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n     GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\r\n     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\r\n     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.\r\n\r\n   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper\r\nmail.\r\n\r\n   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like\r\nthis when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR\r\n     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\r\n     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\r\n     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'\r\n     for details.\r\n\r\n   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\r\nappropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the\r\ncommands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show\r\nc'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\n   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\r\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\r\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\r\n     interest in the program `Gnomovision'\r\n     (which makes passes at compilers) written\r\n     by James Hacker.\r\n\r\n     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989\r\n     Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\n   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your\r\nprogram into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine\r\nlibrary, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary\r\napplications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the\r\nGNU Library General Public License instead of this License","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"262153d2-2f49-44ce-91d8-7b62d87116e3"}
