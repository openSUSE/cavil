Furthermore, any\n    object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the\n    terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions\n    of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the\n    resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I\n    consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral\n    equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You\n    may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide\n    or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General\n    Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input\n    to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of\n    a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or\n    offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The\n    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file\n    is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation\n    of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding\n    my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License\n    spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that","risk":2,"spdx":"Artistic-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-or-later","trademark":0,"unique_id":"29dd56d6-5262-4b80-adbc-9c135358687b"}
