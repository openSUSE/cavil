PREAMBLE<\/title>\n    <para>\n      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or\n      other written document <quote>free<\/quote> in the sense of\n      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and\n      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either\n      commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License\n      preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for\n      their work, while not being considered responsible for\n      modifications made by others.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para>\n      This License is a kind of <quote>copyleft<\/quote>, which means\n      that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in\n      the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,\n      which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para>\n      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for\n      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a\n      free program should come with manuals providing the same\n      freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited\n      to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,\n      regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a\n      printed book. We recommend this License principally for works\n      whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n    <\/para>\n  <\/sect1>\n  <sect1 id=\"fdl-section1\">\n    <title>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<\/title>\n    <para id=\"fdl-document\">\n      This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a\n      notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\n      distributed under the terms of this License. The\n      <quote>Document<\/quote>, below, refers to any such manual or\n      work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed\n      as <quote>you<\/quote>.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para id=\"fdl-modified\">\n      A <quote>Modified Version<\/quote> of the Document means any work\n      containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied\n      verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another\n      language.\n    <\/para>\n\t\n    <para id=\"fdl-secondary\">\n      A <quote>Secondary Section<\/quote> is a named appendix or a\n      front-matter section of the <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> that deals exclusively\n      with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the\n      Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall subject (or to related\n      matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within\n      that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a\n      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\n      mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\n      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of\n      legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\n      regarding them.\n    <\/para>\n\n    <para id=\"fdl-invariant\">\n      The <quote>Invariant Sections<\/quote> are certain <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-secondary\"> Secondary Sections<\/link> whose titles\n      are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the\n      notice that says that the <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> is released under this\n      License.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para id=\"fdl-cover-texts\">\n      The <quote>Cover Texts<\/quote> are certain short passages of\n      text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts,\n      in the notice that says that the <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> is released under this\n      License.\n    <\/para>\n\t\n    <para id=\"fdl-transparent\">\n      A <quote>Transparent<\/quote> copy of the <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-document\"> Document<\/link> means a machine-readable\n      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available\n      to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited\n      directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for\n      images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for\n      drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is\n      suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic\n      translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text\n      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\n      whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\n      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy\n      that is not <quote>Transparent<\/quote> is called\n      <quote>Opaque<\/quote>.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para>\n      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include\n      plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input\n      format, <acronym>SGML<\/acronym> or <acronym>XML<\/acronym> using a publicly available <acronym>DTD<\/acronym>, and\n      standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML<\/acronym> designed for human\n      modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,\n      proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\n      proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML<\/acronym> or <acronym>XML<\/acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD<\/acronym>\n      and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the\n      machine-generated <acronym>HTML<\/acronym> produced by some word processors for\n      output purposes only.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para id=\"fdl-title-page\">\n      The <quote>Title Page<\/quote> means, for a printed book, the\n      title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to\n      hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in\n      the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title\n      page as such, <quote>Title Page<\/quote> means the text near the\n      most prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title, preceding the\n      beginning of the body of the text.\n    <\/para>\n  <\/sect1>\n    \n  <sect1 id=\"fdl-section2\">\n    <title>2. VERBATIM COPYING<\/title>\n    <para>\n      You may copy and distribute the <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> in any medium, either\n      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\n      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License\n      applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that\n      you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this\n      License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or\n      control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or\n      distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for\n      copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you\n      must also follow the conditions in <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-section3\">section 3<\/link>.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para>\n      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated\n      above, and you may publicly display copies.\n    <\/para>\n    <\/sect1>\n    \n  <sect1 id=\"fdl-section3\">\n    <title>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<\/title>\n    <para>\n      If you publish printed copies of the <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> numbering more than 100,\n      and the Document&rsquo;s license notice requires <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-cover-texts\">Cover Texts<\/link>, you must enclose\n      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these\n      Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and\n      Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also\n      clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these\n      copies. The front cover must present the full title with all\n      words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add\n      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes\n      limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the\n      <link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> and satisfy these\n      conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other\n      respects.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para>\n      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\n      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\n      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto\n      adjacent pages.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para>\n      If you publish or distribute <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-transparent\">Opaque<\/link> copies of the <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> numbering more than 100,\n      you must either include a machine-readable <link\n      linkend=\"fdl-transparent\">Transparent<\/link> copy along with\n      each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\n      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a\n      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added\n      material, which the general network-using public has access to\n      download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network\n      protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take\n      reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\n      copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will\n      remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly\n      or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the\n      public.\n    <\/para>\n    \n    <para>\n      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors\n      of the <link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> well before\n      redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance\n      to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n    <\/para>\n    <\/sect1","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.1-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"29a418d9-e44f-4c59-8d0e-5415f0cb275e"}
