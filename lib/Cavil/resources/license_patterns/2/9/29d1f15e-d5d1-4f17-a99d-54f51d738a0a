Even for commercial projects\n there is hardly any need to negotiate a separate license since the\n restrictions of the GNU LGPL or MPL can be matched easily. As a\n general hint, if the zziplib is shipped unmodified with your project\n then you are right within the limits of the free public license.\n<\/P><P>\n Sometimes the question for a personal license comes up for very\n different reason - the need for a support contract and\/or the setting\n of functionality guarantees. The free public licenses include a safeguard\n clause to that end, \"in the hope that it will be useful,\n but <em>without any warranty<\/em>; without even the implied warranty of\n <em>merchantability<\/em> or <em>fitness for a particular purpose<\/em>.\"\n Since the project was developed as a spare time project however there\n have never been personal licenses going beyond.\n<\/P><P>\n In general you can still try to negotiate a support contract but it\n will be very costly. It is much more profitable for you to tell one\n of your developers to have a look at the source code and ensure the\n required functionality is there, with hands on. The source code is \n written to be very readable, maintainable and extensible. Just be\n reminded that the free public licenses have restrictions on shipping\n modified binaries but I can give you a cheap personal license to\n escape these. (Such licenses can be obtained in return for tax-deductible\n donations to organisations supporting opensource software","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"29d1f15e-d5d1-4f17-a99d-54f51d738a0a"}
