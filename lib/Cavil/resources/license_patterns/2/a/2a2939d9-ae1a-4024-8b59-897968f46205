Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1 Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms \r\nof this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed \r\nonly under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include \r\na copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any \r\nSource Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. \r\nHowever, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available \r\nin Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted \r\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available \r\nvia Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially \r\nbecame available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made \r\navailable to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if \r\nthe Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3 Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting \r\nthe changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement \r\nthat the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including \r\nthe name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related \r\ndocumentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4 Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n        (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual \r\nproperty rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor \r\nmust include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making \r\nthe claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after \r\nthe Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in \r\nall copies Contributor makes available thereafter.\r\n        (b) Contributor API's. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor \r\nhas actual knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also \r\ninclude this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n        (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor \r\nbelieves that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights \r\nto grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible \r\nto put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location \r\n(such as a relevant directory) where a user would be most likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more \r\nModification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.\r\nYou must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights \r\nor ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity \r\nor liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, \r\nand not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, \r\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer \r\nand every Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating \r\nto the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity \r\nor liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements \r\nof Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version \r\nof the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have \r\nfulfilled the obligation of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, \r\nrelated documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute \r\nthe Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different \r\nfrom this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable \r\nversion does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth \r\nin this License.\r\nIf You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms \r\nwhich differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby \r\nagree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from \r\nintellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as \r\na result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of \r\nthis License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements \r\nof this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of \r\nthis License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You \r\nmust: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and \r\nthe code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included \r\nwith all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description \r\nmust be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice \r\nin Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the \"SNIA\") may publish revised and\/or new versions of \r\nthe License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may \r\nalways continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms \r\nof any subsequent version of the License published by the SNIA. No one other than the SNIA has the right to modify the \r\nterms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3 Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply \r\nit to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the \r\nphrases \"Storage Networking Industry Association,\" \"SNIA,\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license \r\n(except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the \r\nlicense contains terms which differ from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original \r\nCode or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this \r\nLicense.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY \r\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, \r\nMERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE \r\nCOVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR \r\nANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY \r\nCONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS \r\nDISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein \r\nand fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered \r\nCode which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must \r\nremain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against \r\nInitial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred \r\nto as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n        (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights \r\ngranted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant \r\nterminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant \r\na mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) \r\nwithdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of \r\nnotice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation \r\nclaim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate \r\nat the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version \r\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to \r\nthe initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant \r\nunder Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors \r\nand resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive \r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, \r\nOR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER \r\nOF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY \r\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, \r\nOR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF \r\nSUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM \r\nSUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE \r\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. \r\n1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms \r\nare used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 \r\n(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision \r\nof this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it \r\nenforceable.
