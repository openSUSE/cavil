The\noriginal intention of Andrew M. Kuchling and other contributors has\nbeen to dedicate PyCrypto to the public domain, but that intention was\nnot necessarily made clear in the original disclaimer (see\nLEGAL\/copy\/LICENSE.orig).\n\nAdditionally, some files within PyCrypto had specified their own\nlicenses that differed from the PyCrypto license itself.  For example,\nthe original RIPEMD.c module simply had a copyright statement and\nwarranty disclaimer, without clearly specifying any license terms.\n(An updated version on the author's website came with a license that\ncontained a GPL-incompatible advertising clause.)\n\nTo rectify this situation for PyCrypto 2.1, the following steps have\nbeen taken:\n\n 1. Obtaining explicit permission from the original contributors to\n    dedicate their contributions to the public domain if they have not\n    already done so.  (See the \"LEGAL\/copy\/stmts\" directory for\n    contributors' statements.)\n\n 2. Replacing some modules with clearly-licensed code from other\n    sources (e.g. the DES and DES3 modules were replaced with new ones\n    based on Tom St. Denis's public-domain LibTomCrypt library.)\n\n 3. Replacing some modules with code written from scratch (e.g. the\n    RIPEMD and Blowfish modules were re-implemented from their\n    respective algorithm specifications without reference to the old\n    implementations).\n\n 4. Removing some modules altogether without replacing them.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, with the exceptions noted below or\nwithin the files themselves, the files that constitute PyCrypto are in\nthe public domain.
