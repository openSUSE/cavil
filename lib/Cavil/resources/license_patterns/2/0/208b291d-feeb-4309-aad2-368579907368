Distribution Obligations.<\/B>\n<UL>\n\n    <B>3.1. Application of License.<\/B>\n\n    <BR>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n    Section <B>2.2<\/B>.  The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of\n    this License released under Section <B>6.1<\/B>, and You must include a\n    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n    version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\n    or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an\n    additional document offering the additional rights described in Section\n    <B>3.5<\/B>.\n\n    <P><B>3.2. Availability of Source Code.<\/B>\n\n    <BR>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either\n    on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic\n    Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version\n    available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,\n    must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it\n    initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent\n    version of that particular Modification has been made available to such\n    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version\n    remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is\n    maintained by a third party.\n\n    <P><B>3.3. Description of Modifications.<\/B>\n\n    <BR>You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a\n    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the\n    date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the\n    Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code\n    provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial\n    Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable\n    version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or\n    ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n    <P><B>3.4.

If you obtain such knowledge\n\tafter You make Your Modification available as described in Section\n\t<B>3.2<\/B>, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n\tYou make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as\n\tnotifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably\n\tcalculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new\n\tknowledge has been obtained.\n\n\t<P><B>(b) Contributor APIs<\/B>. \n\n\t<BR>If Your Modification is an application programming interface and\n\tYou own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to\n\timplement that API, you must also include this information in the\n\tLEGAL file.\n\n    <\/UL>\n\n    <P><B>3.5. Required Notices.<\/B>\n\n    <BR>You must duplicate the notice in <B>Exhibit A<\/B> in each file of the\n    Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code,\n    where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You\n    created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a\n    Contributor to the notice described in <B>Exhibit A<\/B>. If it is not\n    possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\n    structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a\n    relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a\n    notice.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\n    support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of\n    Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n    behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.  You must make it\n    absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n    obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the\n    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n    <P><B>3.6.

The notice must be conspicuously included in any\n    notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in\n    which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You\n    may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of\n    Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,\n    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and\n    that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or\n    alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights\n    set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under\n    a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms\n    which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the\n    Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You\n    offer.\n\n    <P><B>3.7. Larger Works.<\/B>\n\n    <BR>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n    Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n<\/UL>\n<B>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<\/B>\n<UL>\n\n    <P>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or\n    regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to\n    the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the\n    code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n    described in Section <B>3.4<\/B> and must be included with all\n    distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by\n    statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for\n    a recipient of ordinary skill\n    to be able to understand it.\n\n<\/UL>\n<B>5. Application of this License.<\/B>\n<UL>\n\n    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached\n    the notice in <B>Exhibit A<\/B>, and to related Covered Code.\n\n<\/UL>\n<B>6. Versions of the License.<\/B>\n<UL>\n\n    <B>6.1. New Versions<\/B>. \n\n    <BR>Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish\n    revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time.  Each\n    version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n    <P><B>6.2. Effect of New Versions<\/B>. \n\n    <BR>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n    version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of\n    any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other\n    than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\n    Code created under this License.\n\n    <P><B>6.3. Derivative Works<\/B>. \n\n    <BR>If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered\n    Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that\n    the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL''\n    or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license\n    and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains\n    terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public\n    License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or\n    Contributor in the notice described in <B>Exhibit A<\/B> shall not of\n    themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n<\/UL>\n<B>7.

TERMINATION.<\/B>\n<UL>\n\n    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n    such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n    sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive\n    any termination of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, must\n    remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n<\/UL>\n<B>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<\/B>\n<UL>\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF\n    ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY\n    INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER\n    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\n    STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED\n    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL\n    NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\n    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION\n    OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION\n    MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n<\/UL>\n<B>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<\/B>\n<UL>\n\n    The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48\n    C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software''\n    and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are\n    used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n    and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set\n    forth herein.\n\n<\/UL>\n<B>11.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<\/B>\n<UL>\n\n    Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with\n    Section <B>3.4<\/B>, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or\n    indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based\n    on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues\n    you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors.
