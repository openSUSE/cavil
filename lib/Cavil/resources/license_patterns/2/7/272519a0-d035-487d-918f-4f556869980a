{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-2.0 AND BSD-3-Clause","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The DPDK uses the Open Source BSD-3-Clause license for the core libraries and\r\ndrivers. The kernel components are naturally GPL-2.0 licensed.\r\n\r\nIncluding big blocks of License headers in all files blows up the\r\nsource code with mostly redundant information.  An additional problem\r\nis that even the same licenses are referred to by a number of\r\nslightly varying text blocks (full, abbreviated, different\r\nindentation, line wrapping and\/or white space, with obsolete address\r\ninformation, ...) which makes validation and automatic processing a nightmare.\r\n\r\nTo make this easier, DPDK uses a single line reference to Unique License\r\nIdentifiers in source files as defined by the Linux Foundation's SPDX project\r\n(https:\/\/spdx.org\/).\r\n\r\nAdding license information in this fashion, rather than adding full license\r\ntext, can be more efficient for developers; decreases errors; and improves\r\nautomated detection of licenses. The current set of valid, predefined SPDX\r\nidentifiers is set forth on the SPDX License List at https:\/\/spdx.org\/licenses\/.\r\n\r\nDPDK uses first line of the file to be SPDX tag. In case of *#!* scripts, SPDX\r\ntag can be placed in 2nd line of the file.\r\n\r\nFor example, to label a file as subject to the BSD-3-Clause license,\r\nthe following text would be used:\r\n\r\nSPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause\r\n\r\nTo label a file as GPL-2.0 (e.g., for code that runs in the kernel), the\r\nfollowing text would be used:\r\n\r\nSPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0\r\n\r\nTo label a file as dual-licensed with BSD-3-Clause and GPL-2.0 (e.g., for code\r\nthat is shared between the kernel and userspace), the following text would be\r\nused:\r\n\r\nSPDX-License-Identifier: (BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0)\r\n\r\nTo label a file as dual-licensed with BSD-3-Clause and LGPL-2.1 (e.g., for code\r\nthat is shared between the kernel and userspace), the following text would be\r\nused:\r\n\r\nSPDX-License-Identifier: (BSD-3-Clause OR LGPL-2.1)\r\n\r\nAny new file contributions in DPDK shall adhere to the above scheme.\r\nIt is also being recommended to replace the existing license text in the code\r\nwith SPDX-License-Identifiers.\r\n\r\nAny exception to the DPDK IP policies shall be approved by DPDK Tech Board and\r\nDPDK Governing Board. Steps for any exception approval:\r\n1. Mention the appropriate license identifier form SPDX. If the license is not\r\n   listed in SPDX Licenses. It is the submitters responsibiliity to get it\r\n   first listed.\r\n2. Get the required approval from the DPDK Technical Board. Technical Board may\r\n   advise the author to check alternate means first. If no other alternative\r\n   are found and the merit of the contributions are important for DPDK's\r\n   mission, it may decide on such exception with two-thirds vote of the members.\r\n3. Technical Board then approach Governing Board for such limited approval for\r\n   the given contribution only","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-only AND BSD-3-Clause","trademark":0,"unique_id":"272519a0-d035-487d-918f-4f556869980a"}
