They realized that by releasing also\nthe code for free, VNC would become an evolving little child, conquering\nnew worlds, making it's parents very proud. As well they can be! To protect\nthis innovation, they decided to make it GPL, not BSD. The principal\ndifference is: You can make closed source programs deriving from BSD, not\nfrom GPL. You have to give proper credit with both.\n\nNow, why not BSD? Well, imagine your child being some famous actor. Along\ncomes a manager who exploits your child exclusively, that is: nobody else\ncan profit from the child, it itself included. Got it?\n\nWhat reason do you have now to use this library commercially?\n\nSeveral: You don't have to give away your product. Then you have effectively\ncircumvented the GPL, because you have the benefits of other's work and you\ndon't give back anything and you will be in hell for that. In fact, this\nlibrary, as my other projects, is a payback for all the free software I can\nuse (and sometimes, make better).
