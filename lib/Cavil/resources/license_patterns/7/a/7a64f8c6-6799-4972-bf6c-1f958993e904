This is the same code that Pixar uses internally for animated\r\nfilm production. Our intent is to encourage a geometry standard for subdivision \r\nsurfaces, by providing consistent (i.e. yielding the same limit surface), high \r\nperformance implementations on a variety of platforms.\r\n\r\nWhy Apache? We were looking for a commercial-friendly license that would convey \r\nour patents to the end users. This quickly narrowed the field to Microsoft Public \r\nLicense or Apache. Initially we chose MSPL because it handled trademarks better. \r\nBut at the request of several companies we gave Apache another look, and decided \r\nto go with Apache with a very slight modification that simply says you cannot use \r\nany contributors' trademarks. In other words, you can use OpenSubdiv to make a \r\nproduct, but you cannot use a Luxo Lamp (or other character, etc.) when marketing \r\nyour product.\r\n\r\n`License Header <license.html","risk":4,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"7a64f8c6-6799-4972-bf6c-1f958993e904"}
