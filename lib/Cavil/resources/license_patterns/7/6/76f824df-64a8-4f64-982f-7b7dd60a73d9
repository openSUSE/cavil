{"license":"ODbL-1.0","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"ODC Open Database License (ODbL) Preamble\r\n\r\nThe Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow\r\nusers to freely share, modify, and use this Database while maintaining this\r\nsame freedom for others. Many databases are covered by copyright, and therefore\r\nthis document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the European\r\nUnion, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses\r\nthese rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for\r\nusers of this Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this\r\nDatabase.\r\n\r\nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual\r\nmaterial, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL\r\nonly governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database\r\nindividually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license\r\nfor the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly\r\ncovers all of the contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different\r\nrights, Licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together\r\nin the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.\r\n\r\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered\r\nby other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark\r\nover the name, or privacy rights \/ data protection rights over information\r\nin the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other\r\ndocuments or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe Licensor (as defined below)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nYou (as defined below)\r\n\r\nagree as follows:\r\n\r\n   1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words\r\n\r\n\"Collective Database\" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part of\r\na collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled\r\ninto a collective whole.

Legal effect of this document. This License is:\r\n\r\n      a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;\r\n\r\n      b. A license of the Database Right; and\r\n\r\n      c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.\r\n\r\n2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the Database,\r\nincluding:\r\n\r\na. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright\r\nlicensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover\r\nthe copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See Section\r\n2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely\r\nto cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement,\r\nand organisation of the Database, and can also include the Database tables\r\nand table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of\r\nContents stored in the Database;\r\n\r\nb. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and Re-utilisation\r\nof the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database Rights can apply\r\neven when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also\r\napply when the Contents are removed from the Database and are selected and\r\narranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright; and\r\n\r\nc. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access\r\nto the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on this\r\naccess as outlined in this License.\r\n\r\n   2.3 Rights not covered.\r\n\r\na. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or\r\noperation of the Database;\r\n\r\nb. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database;\r\nand\r\n\r\nc. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the Database.\r\n\r\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the\r\nContents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, including\r\ncopyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this\r\nLicense does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract)\r\nin individual Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on\r\na Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright\r\nover individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one\r\nsingle license covering all of the rights over the images.\r\n\r\n   3.0 Rights granted\r\n\r\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants\r\nto You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under\r\nSection 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable\r\ncopyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial\r\nuse, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in\r\nthe relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and\r\nformats whether now known or created in the future.\r\n\r\n   The rights granted cover, for example:\r\n\r\na. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the\r\nContents;\r\n\r\n      b. Creation of Derivative Databases;\r\n\r\n      c. Creation of Collective Databases;\r\n\r\nd. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any\r\nform, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a part\r\nof Collective Databases; and\r\n\r\ne. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or performance\r\nto the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including\r\nof any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective Databases.\r\n\r\n   3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\na. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which\r\nthe right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing\r\nscheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect\r\nsuch royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\r\n\r\nb. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the\r\nright to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme\r\ncan be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties\r\nfor any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\r\n\r\nc. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,\r\nwhether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting\r\nsociety that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from\r\nany exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\r\n\r\n3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop distributing\r\nor making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this Database may\r\nbe multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using alternative\r\nlicenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not\r\nexpressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\r\n\r\n   4.0 Conditions of Use\r\n\r\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your\r\ncomplying with the following conditions of use. These are important conditions\r\nof this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material breach\r\nof its terms.\r\n\r\n4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database,\r\nor the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:\r\n\r\na. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license permitted\r\nunder Section 4.4;\r\n\r\nb. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license permitted\r\nunder Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database\r\nor Derivative Database, including both in the Database or Derivative Database\r\nand in any relevant documentation; and\r\n\r\nc. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer\r\nto this License.\r\n\r\nd. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file\r\ndue to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such\r\nas a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.\r\n\r\n4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work\r\ndoes not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a\r\nProduced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work\r\nreasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts\r\nwith, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was\r\nobtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of\r\na Collective Database, and that it is available under this License.\r\n\r\na. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:\r\n\r\nContains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available here under\r\nthe Open Database License (ODbL).\r\n\r\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink\r\nto the URI of the Database. \"Open Database License\" should contain a hyperlink\r\nto the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible, You\r\nshould include the plain text of the required URI's with the above notice.\r\n\r\n   4.4 Share alike.\r\n\r\na. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under the terms\r\nof:\r\n\r\n         i. This License;\r\n\r\nii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this License; or\r\n\r\n         iii. A compatible license.\r\n\r\nIf You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses mentioned\r\nin (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.\r\n\r\nb. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the whole or\r\na Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a Derivative Database\r\nand must comply with Section 4.4.\r\n\r\nc. Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is Publicly\r\nUsed and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work created from\r\nthe Derivative Database is Publicly Used.\r\n\r\nd. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, You must\r\nnot add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are incompatible\r\nwith the rights granted under this License.\r\n\r\ne. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine compatible\r\nlicenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the authorised proxy's public\r\nstatement of acceptance of a compatible license grants You permission to use\r\nthe compatible license.\r\n\r\n4.5 Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply in\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\na. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license Collective\r\nDatabases under this License if You incorporate this Database or a Derivative\r\nDatabase in the collection, but this License still applies to this Database\r\nor a Derivative Database as a part of the Collective Database;\r\n\r\nb. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of\r\na Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not create a Derivative\r\nDatabase for purposes of Section 4.4; and\r\n\r\nc. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to\r\nthe public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section 4.4.\r\n\r\n4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative Database\r\nor a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also offer to recipients\r\nof the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy in a machine readable form\r\nof:\r\n\r\n      a. The entire Derivative Database; or\r\n\r\nb. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or the method\r\nof making the alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm), including\r\nany additional Contents, that make up all the differences between the Database\r\nand the Derivative Database.\r\n\r\nThe Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be available\r\nat no more than a reasonable production cost for physical distributions and\r\nfree of charge if distributed over the internet.\r\n\r\n   4.7 Technological measures and additional terms\r\n\r\na. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to Section 4.7\r\nb.) any terms or any technological measures on the Database, a Derivative\r\nDatabase, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents that alter or\r\nrestrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have\r\nthe effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise\r\nthose rights.\r\n\r\nb. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological measures on\r\nthe Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of\r\nthe Contents (a \"Restricted Database\") in contravention of Section 4.74 a.\r\nonly if You also make a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database available\r\nto the recipient of the Restricted Database:\r\n\r\n         i. That is available without additional fee;\r\n\r\nii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict the terms\r\nof this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent\r\nof restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights (an \"Unrestricted\r\nDatabase\"); and\r\n\r\niii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the recipient\r\nas a practical matter as the Restricted Database.\r\n\r\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a Derivative\r\nDatabase in an authenticated environment, behind a password, or within a similar\r\naccess control scheme provided that You do not alter or restrict the terms\r\nof this License or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent\r\nof restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights.\r\n\r\n4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You\r\ncommunicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or\r\nany Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to\r\nthe recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as\r\nthis License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties\r\nwith this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative\r\nDatabase. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative\r\nDatabase made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose\r\nany further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\r\nunder this License.\r\n\r\n   5.0 Moral rights\r\n\r\n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to\r\nbe identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that\r\nwould otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other\r\nderogatory treatment:\r\n\r\na. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all\r\nmoral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent\r\npossible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;\r\n\r\nb. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction\r\nis not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database\r\nand waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the\r\nlaw of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and\r\n\r\nc. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral\r\nrights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights\r\nover certain aspects of the Database.\r\n\r\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights,\r\nand so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n   6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected\r\n\r\n6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently\r\nhave under any applicable law to make any use of this Database, including\r\nwithout limitation:\r\n\r\na. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from\r\nnon-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of\r\nillustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or Re-utilisation\r\nfor public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.\r\n\r\nb. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception\r\nto infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.\r\n\r\n6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and\r\nRe-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or\r\nqualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative\r\nDatabase (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The\r\nrepeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts\r\nof the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of\r\na Substantial part of the Contents.\r\n\r\n   7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\n7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor \"as is\" and without any warranty\r\nof any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course\r\nof dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied\r\nwarranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or completeness,\r\nthe presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability,\r\nor otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties,\r\nso this exclusion may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n   8.0 Limitation of liability\r\n\r\n8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the\r\nLicensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss\r\nor damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License,\r\nwhether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part\r\nof the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited\r\nto, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages\r\nsuch as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This\r\nexclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility\r\nof such damages.\r\n\r\n8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct\r\nfinancial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part\r\nof the Licensor.\r\n\r\n   9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License\r\n\r\n9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically\r\nterminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For\r\nthe avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the Database, the whole\r\nor a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database\r\nas part of a Collective Database from You under this License will not have\r\ntheir licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this\r\nLicense or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1,\r\n2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this License.\r\n\r\n9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will\r\nnot terminate Your rights under it.\r\n\r\n9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for\r\nthe duration of applicable rights in the Database.\r\n\r\n9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions\r\nof this License, then your full rights under this License will be reinstated:\r\n\r\na. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day after\r\ncessation of breach;\r\n\r\nb. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise\r\nreasonably notified by the Licensor; or\r\n\r\nc. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this\r\nis the first time You have received notice of violation of this License from\r\nthe Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt\r\nof the notice.\r\n\r\nPersons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to be\r\na recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.\r\n\r\n9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\r\nDatabase under different license terms or to stop distributing or making available\r\nthe Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms or stopping\r\nthe distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License (or any other\r\nlicense that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this\r\nLicense), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated\r\nas stated above.\r\n\r\n   10.0 General\r\n\r\n10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable,\r\nthat must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\r\nterms and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this\r\nLicense shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.\r\n\r\n10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect\r\nto the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier understandings,\r\nagreements or representations with respect to the Database.\r\n\r\n10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be entitled\r\nto rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach by the Licensor.\r\n\r\n10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the\r\nlaws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to\r\nbe enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright\r\nlaw and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional rights\r\nnot granted under this License, these additional rights are granted in this\r\nLicense in order to meet the terms of this License.\r\n","risk":4,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"76f824df-64a8-4f64-982f-7b7dd60a73d9"}
