(For example, if the Document is in part a\n      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\n      mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\n      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of\n      legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\n      regarding them.\n    <\/p>\n<p><a name=\"fdl-invariant\"><\/a>\n      The <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">Invariant Sections<\/span>”<\/span> are certain <a class=\"link\" href=\"fdl-section1.html#fdl-secondary\"> Secondary Sections<\/a> whose titles\n      are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the\n      notice that says that the <a class=\"link\" href=\"fdl-section1.html#fdl-document\">Document<\/a> is released under this\n      License.\n    <\/p>\n<p><a name=\"fdl-cover-texts\"><\/a>\n      The <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">Cover Texts<\/span>”<\/span> are certain short passages of\n      text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts,\n      in the notice that says that the <a class=\"link\" href=\"fdl-section1.html#fdl-document\">Document<\/a> is released under this\n      License.\n    <\/p>\n<p><a name=\"fdl-transparent\"><\/a>\n      A <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">Transparent<\/span>”<\/span> copy of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"fdl-section1.html#fdl-document\"> Document<\/a> means a machine-readable\n      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available\n      to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited\n      directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for\n      images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for\n      drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is\n      suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic\n      translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text\n      formatters.
