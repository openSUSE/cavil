Can I use it without open sourcing my own code?\r\n\r\nA: No, it is not GPL. You just can choose to use it with the GPL license, in\r\n   which case you are bound to open source your own code as well. You can just\r\n   as well choose to use the zlib license though. See gpl.txt and zlib.txt for\r\n   details of both licenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: So does this mean, AllegroGL has not the same license as Allegro? Why is\r\n   that? Will it change?\r\n\r\nA: Apparently, it seems to not be the same license. We (current developers) do\r\n   not know why this is either - but it's how the original authors licensed it.\r\n   We would like to change the license to be the same as Allegro and likely\r\n   will do so for new versions","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"734d9d9d-7a82-4c41-a02f-f1437715830d"}
