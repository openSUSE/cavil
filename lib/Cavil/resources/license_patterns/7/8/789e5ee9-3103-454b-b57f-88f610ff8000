{"license":"GPL-2.0 WITH FLOSS-exception","opinion":0,"packname":"xsd","patent":0,"pattern":"We want specified Free\/Libre and Open Source Software (\"FLOSS\") to be\nable to use the specified GPL-licensed XSD runtime library (libxsd) and\nXSD generated code (collectively called the \"Program\") despite the fact\nthat not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License (the \"GPL\").\n\nIt is our intent to allow distribution of the entire Derivative Work\n(including the Program) under one or more of the FLOSS licenses listed\nin section 3 (section 2.a). It is also our intent to disallow simple\nrelicensing of the Program for the sole purpose of using it in\nproprietary applications (section 2.b and 2.c). As an example, consider\ntwo hypothetical scenarios:\n\n a) You created a program that uses the XSD generated code and the XSD\n    runtime library to access information in XML instance documents.\n    Your program performs useful computations based on this information\n    (sections 2.b and 2.c are satisfied). You distribute your program,\n    including the XSD generated code and the XSD runtime library under\n    the BSD license and make it available at no charge to all third\n    parties (section 2.a is satisfied). Later you (or someone else) may\n    choose to base their proprietary application on your code since the\n    BSD license does not prohibit it.\n\n    This scenario falls under this FLOSS Exception.\n\n\n b) You created a library that uses the XSD generated code and the XSD\n    runtime library to access information in XML instance documents. You\n    did not add to the library any other useful code that uses the XSD\n    generated code or the XSD runtime library (neither section 2.b nor\n    2.c is satisfied). You distribute your library, including the XSD\n    generated code and the XSD runtime library under the BSD license and\n    make it available at no charge to all third parties (section 2.a\n    is satisfied). Later you base your proprietary application on this\n    library since the BSD license does not prohibit it.\n\n    This scenario does not fall under this FLOSS Exception (neither\n    section 2.b nor 2.c is satisfied). You created the library for the\n    sole purpose of making the XSD generated code and the XSD runtime\n    library available to your proprietary application.\n\n\n2. Legal Terms and Conditions\n\nAs a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2 of\nthe GPL you are free to distribute a verbatim copy of the Program\nas part of the Derivative Work that is formed from the Program or\nany part thereof and one or more works (each, a \"FLOSS Work\") as\nlong as you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n  a) You must cause the Derivative Work that in whole or in part\n     contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\n     to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n     under the terms of one or more of the licenses listed in\n     section 3.\n\n  b) The Derivative Work should contain one or more FLOSS Work that\n     can be reasonably considered as derived from the Program or some\n     part thereof.\n\n  c) The Derivative Work should not contain any part of the Program\n     that cannot be reasonably considered as a base of one or more\n     FLOSS Work.\n\n\n3.
