Patent Infringement.\r\n\r\n   You agree that you will not bring or threaten to bring any action against PKWARE\r\n   for infringement of the claims of any patent owned or controlled by you solely\r\n   as a result of PKWARE's own implementation of the Licensed Technology.  As its\r\n   exclusive remedy for your breach of the foregoing agreement, PKWARE reserves\r\n   the right to suspend or terminate all rights granted under the terms of this\r\n   AGREEMENT if you bring or threaten to bring any such action against PKWARE,\r\n   effective immediately upon delivery of written notice of suspension or\r\n   termination to you.\r\n\r\n   h.
