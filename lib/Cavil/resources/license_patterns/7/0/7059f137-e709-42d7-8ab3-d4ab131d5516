{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GPL-2.0","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n     under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\",\n     below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on\n     the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under\n     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a\n     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n     included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  Each\n     licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\n     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act\n     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the\n     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on\n     the Program (independent of having been made by running the\n     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of\n     this License along with the Program.\n\n     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange\n     for a fee.\n\n  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that\n          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program\n          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge\n          to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display\n          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and\n          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you\n          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the\n          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to\n          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program\n          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\n          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required\n          to print an announcement.)\n\n     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the\n     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate\n     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not\n     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a\n     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of\n     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions\n     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each\n     and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\n     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the\n     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\n     derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\n     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\n     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on\n     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\n     other work under the scope of this License.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\n     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\n     following:\n\n       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\n          software interchange; or,\n\n       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n          received the program in object code or executable form with\n          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\n     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete\n     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\n     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\n     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.\n     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\n     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\n     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable\n     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\n     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\n     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\n     from you under this License will not have their licenses\n     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify\n     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions\n     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\n     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work\n     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this\n     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\n     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program\n     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any\n     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\n     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\n     by third parties to this License.\n\n  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent\n     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\n     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\n     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\n     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\n     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\n     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit\n     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only\n     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\n     entirely from distribution of the Program","risk":2,"spdx":"GPL-2.0-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"7059f137-e709-42d7-8ab3-d4ab131d5516"}
