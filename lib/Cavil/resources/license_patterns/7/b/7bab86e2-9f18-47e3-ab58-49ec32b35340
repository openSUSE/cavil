See also the related \"W3C Community Contributor License Agreement\".\r\n1. The Purpose of this Agreement.\r\nThis Agreement sets forth the terms under which I make certain copyright and patent rights available to you for your \r\nimplementation of the Specification. \r\nAny other capitalized terms not specifically defined herein have the same meaning as those terms have in the \"W3C Patent \r\nPolicy\", and if not defined there, in the \"W3C Process Document\".\r\n2. Copyrights. \r\n2.1. Copyright Grant. I grant to you a perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive, \r\nno-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative \r\nworks of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement the Specification to the full extent \r\nof my copyright interest in the Specification. \r\n2.2. Attribution. As a condition of the copyright grant, you must include an attribution to the Specification in any \r\nderivative work you make based on the Specification. That attribution must include, at minimum, the Specification name \r\nand version number.\r\n3. Patents. \r\n3.1. Patent Licensing Commitment. I agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C Community RF Licensing Requirements. \r\nThis requirement includes Essential Claims that I own and any that I have the right to license without obligation of \r\npayment or other consideration to an unrelated third party. W3C Community RF Licensing Requirements obligations made \r\nconcerning the Specification and described in this policy are binding on me for the life of the patents in question \r\nand encumber the patents containing Essential Claims, regardless of changes in participation status or W3C Membership. \r\nI also agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C Community RF Licensing Requirements in derivative works of \r\nthe Specification so long as all normative portions of the Specification are maintained and that this licensing commitment \r\ndoes not extend to any portion of the derivative work that was not included in the Specification.\r\n3.2. Optional, Additional Patent Grant. In addition to the provisions of Section 3.1, I may also, at my option, make \r\ncertain intellectual property rights infringed by implementations of the Specification, including Essential Claims, \r\navailable by providing those terms via the W3C Web site.\r\n4. No Other Rights. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, no other express or implied patent, trademark, \r\ncopyright, or other property rights are granted under this Agreement, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.\r\n5. Antitrust Compliance. I acknowledge that I may compete with other participants, that I am under no obligation to \r\nimplement the Specification, that each participant is free to develop competing technologies and standards, and that \r\neach party is free to license its patent rights to third parties, including for the purpose of enabling competing technologies \r\nand standards.\r\n6. Non-Circumvention. I agree that I will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any action \r\nfor the purpose of circumventing my obligations under this Agreement.\r\n7. Transition to W3C Recommendation Track. The Specification developed by the Project may transition to the W3C Recommendation \r\nTrack. The W3C Team is responsible for notifying me that a Corresponding Working Group has been chartered. I have no \r\nobligation to join the Corresponding Working Group. If the Specification developed by the Project transitions to the \r\nW3C Recommendation Track, the following terms apply: \r\n7.1. If I join the Corresponding Working Group. If I join the Corresponding Working Group, I will be subject to all \r\nW3C rules, obligations, licensing commitments, and policies that govern that Corresponding Working Group.\r\n7.2. If I Do Not Join the Corresponding Working Group. \r\n7.2.1. Licensing Obligations to Resulting Specification. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I agree to \r\noffer patent licenses according to the W3C Royalty-Free licensing requirements described in Section 5 of the W3C Patent \r\nPolicy for the portions of the Specification included in the resulting Recommendation. This licensing commitment does \r\nnot extend to any portion of an implementation of the Recommendation that was not included in the Specification. This \r\nlicensing commitment may not be revoked but may be modified through the exclusion process defined in Section 4 of the \r\nW3C Patent Policy. I am not required to join the Corresponding Working Group to exclude patents from the W3C Royalty-Free \r\nlicensing commitment, but must otherwise follow the normal exclusion procedures defined by the W3C Patent Policy. The \r\nW3C Team will notify me of any Call for Exclusion in the Corresponding Working Group as set forth in Section 4.5 of \r\nthe W3C Patent Policy.\r\n7.2.2. No Disclosure Obligation. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I have no patent disclosure obligations \r\noutside of those set forth in Section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy.\r\n8. Conflict of Interest. I will disclose significant relationships when those relationships might reasonably be perceived \r\nas creating a conflict of interest with my role. I will notify W3C of any change in my affiliation using W3C-provided \r\nmechanisms.\r\n9. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers. I represent and warrant that I am legally entitled to grant the rights \r\nand promises set forth in this Agreement. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED AS IS. The entire risk \r\nas to implementing or otherwise using the Specification is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein, \r\nI expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, \r\nnon-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY \r\nBE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES \r\nOF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, \r\nTORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF \r\nSUCH DAMAGE. All of my obligations under Section 3 regarding the transfer, successors in interest, or assignment of \r\nGranted Claims will be satisfied if I notify the transferee or assignee of any patent that I know contains Granted Claims \r\nof the obligations under Section 3. Nothing in this Agreement requires me to undertake a patent search.\r\n10. Definitions. \r\n10.1. Agreement. Agreement means this W3C Community Final Specification Agreement.\r\n10.2. Corresponding Working Group. Corresponding Working Group is a W3C Working Group that is chartered to develop \r\na Recommendation, as defined in the W3C Process Document, that takes the Specification as an input.\r\n10.3. Essential Claims. Essential Claims shall mean all claims in any patent or patent application in any jurisdiction \r\nin the world that would necessarily be infringed by implementation of the Specification. A claim is necessarily infringed \r\nhereunder only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it because there is no non-infringing alternative for implementing \r\nthe normative portions of the Specification. Existence of a non-infringing alternative shall be judged based on the \r\nstate of the art at the time of the publication of the Specification. The following are expressly excluded from and \r\nshall not be deemed to constitute Essential Claims: \r\n10.3.1. any claims other than as set forth above even if contained in the same patent as Essential Claims; and\r\n10.3.2. claims which would be infringed only by: \r\nportions of an implementation that are not specified in the normative portions of the Specification, or\r\nenabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the Specification \r\nand are not themselves expressly set forth in the Specification (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler \r\ntechnology, object-oriented technology, basic operating system technology, and the like); or\r\nthe implementation of technology developed elsewhere and merely incorporated by reference in the body of the Specification.\r\n10.3.3. design patents and design registrations.\r\nFor purposes of this definition, the normative portions of the Specification shall be deemed to include only architectural \r\n","risk":4,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"7bab86e2-9f18-47e3-ab58-49ec32b35340"}
