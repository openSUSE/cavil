{"export_restricted":0,"license":"GFDL-1.2","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice\n     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These\n     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in\n     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\n     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and\n     has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n  2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\n     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\n     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\n     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License\n     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you\n     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You\n     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading\n     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,\n     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you\n     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow\n     the conditions in section 3.\n\n     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,\n     and you may publicly display copies.\n\n  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly\n     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and\n     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must\n     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all\n     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and\n     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly\n     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The\n     front cover must present the full title with all words of the\n     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material\n     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the\n     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and\n     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in\n     other respects.\n\n     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\n     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\n     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto\n     adjacent pages.\n\n     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document\n     numbering more than 100, you must either include a\n     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or\n     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from\n     which the general network-using public has access to download\n     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent\n     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the\n     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you\n     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that\n     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\n     location until at least one year after the last time you\n     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or\n     retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\n     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of\n     the Document well before redistributing any large number of\n     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated\n     version of the Document.\n\n  4. MODIFICATIONS\n\n     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document\n     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you\n     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with\n     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus\n     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to\n     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these\n     things in the Modified Version:\n\n       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title\n          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of\n          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed\n          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the\n          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of\n          that version gives permission.\n\n       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or\n          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in\n          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the\n          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal\n          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you\n          from this requirement.\n\n       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n          Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\n       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n          adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license\n          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified\n          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in\n          the Addendum below.\n\n       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant\n          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's\n          license notice.\n\n       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n       I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title,\n          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new\n          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on\n          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in\n          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,\n          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,\n          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in\n          the previous sentence.\n\n       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document\n          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and\n          likewise the network locations given in the Document for\n          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in\n          the \"History\" section.  You may omit a network location for a\n          work that was published at least four years before the\n          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version\n          it refers to gives permission.\n\n       K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the\n          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor\n          acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.\n\n       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section\n          titles.\n\n       M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n          may not be included in the Modified Version.\n\n       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled\n          \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant\n          Section.\n\n       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\n     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no\n     material copied from the Document, you may at your option\n     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,\n     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified\n     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any\n     other section titles.\n\n     You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\n     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\n     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text\n     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative\n     definition of a standard.\n\n     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,\n     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end\n     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one\n     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be\n     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the\n     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,\n     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity\n     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may\n     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous\n     publisher that added the old one.\n\n     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this\n     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to\n     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n     You may combine the Document with other documents released under\n     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for\n     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination\n     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,\n     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your\n     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all\n     their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\n     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\n     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name\n     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique\n     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the\n     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a\n     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in\n     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\n     combined work.\n\n     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled\n     \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section\n     Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\n     \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".  You\n     must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements.\"\n\n  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\n     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other\n     documents released under this License, and replace the individual\n     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy\n     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the\n     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the\n     documents in all other respects.\n\n     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and\n     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert\n     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow\n     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of\n     that document.\n\n  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\n     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other\n     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of\n     a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the\n     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the\n     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual\n     works permit.  When the Document is included an aggregate, this\n     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which\n     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\n     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\n     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half\n     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed\n     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\n     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic\n     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket\n     the whole aggregate.\n\n  8. TRANSLATION\n\n     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section\n     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\n     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\n     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\n     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\n     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also\n     include the original English version of this License and the\n     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a\n     disagreement between the translation and the original version of\n     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\n     prevail.\n\n     If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n     \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to\n     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the\n     actual title.\n\n  9. TERMINATION\n\n     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\n     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other\n     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is\n     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\n     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\n     from you under this License will not have their licenses\n     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of\n     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\n     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\n     `http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/'.\n\n     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version\n     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered\n     version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you\n     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n     that specified version or of any later version that has been\n     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If\n     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,\n     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the\n     Free Software Foundation.\n\nA.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and license\nnotices just after the title page:\n\n       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\n       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\n       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU\n       Free Documentation License''.\n\n   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover\nTexts, replace the \"with...Texts.\" line with this:\n\n         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with\n         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts\n         being LIST.\n\n   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n\n   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to\npermit their use in free software","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.2-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"e567b093-d79a-49ee-9a8b-49da92fd4d91"}
