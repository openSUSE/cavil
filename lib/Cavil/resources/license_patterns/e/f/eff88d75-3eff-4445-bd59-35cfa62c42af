THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS\n CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND\n CONDITIONS.\n .\n 1. Definitions\n .\n \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or\n encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with\n a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in\n themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a\n Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for\n the purposes of this License.  \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the\n Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,\n musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,\n sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form\n in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work\n that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for\n the purpose of this License.\n .\n \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms\n of this License.  \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created\n the Work.\n .\n \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of\n this License.  \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect\n to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\n exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n .\n 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or\n restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on\n the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other\n applicable laws.\n .\n 3.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\n hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the\n duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the\n Work as stated below:\n .\n a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective\n Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n .\n b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n .\n c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,\n and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work\n including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n .\n d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,\n and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;\n .\n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or\n hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such\n modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other\n media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby\n reserved.\n .\n 4. Restrictions.\n .\n The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited\n by the following restrictions:\n .\n a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must\n include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with\n every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,\n publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose\n any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the\n recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense\n the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to\n the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,\n publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological\n measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with\n the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as\n incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective\n Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You\n must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference\n to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a\n Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or\n the Original Author, as requested.\n .\n b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep\n intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit\n reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or\n pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the\n Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the\n use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work\n by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\n however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum\n such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears\n and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship\n credit.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor\n represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after\n reasonable inquiry:\n .\n i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license\n rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted\n hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory\n license fees, residuals or any other payments;\n .\n ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common\n law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,\n invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.\n .\n b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR\n REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT\n WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability.

Termination\n .\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\n upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities\n who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this\n License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such\n individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections\n 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n .\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work\n under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\n provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this\n License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force\n and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous\n .\n Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective\n Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n .\n Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,\n Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n .\n If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\n law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\n terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this\n agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to\n make such provision valid and enforceable.\n .\n No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by\n the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n .\n This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect\n to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or\n representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not\n be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\n You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of\n the Licensor and You","risk":2,"spdx":"CC-BY-1.0","trademark":0,"unique_id":"eff88d75-3eff-4445-bd59-35cfa62c42af"}
