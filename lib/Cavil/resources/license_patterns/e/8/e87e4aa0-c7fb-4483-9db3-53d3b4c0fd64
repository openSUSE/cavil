This so-called \"dual license\" \nmodel was chosen to provide potential revenues for the Blender Foundation. \n\nThe BL has not been activated yet. Partially because;\n\n- there has to be a clear benefit for Blender itself and its community of \n  developers and users.\n- the developers who have copyrighted additions to the source code need to approve \n  the decision.\n- the (c) holder NaN Holding has to approve on a standard License Contract\n\nBut most important; \n\n- the Blender Foundation is financially healthy, based on community support\n  (e-shop sales), sponsoring and subsidy grants\n- current focus for the Blender Foundation is to not set up any commercial\n  activity related to Blender development.\n- the GNU GPL provides sufficient freedom for third parties to conduct business\n  with Blender\n\nFor these reasons we've decided to cancel the BL offering for an indefinite period.\n\nThird parties interested to discuss usage or exploitation of Blender can email \nlicense@blender.org for further information.\n\nTon Roosendaal\nChairman Blender Foundation.\nJune 2005","risk":2,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"e87e4aa0-c7fb-4483-9db3-53d3b4c0fd64"}
