{"license":"OFL-1.1","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"5  ABOUT THE LICENSE\n\n5.1  I see that this is version 1.1 of the license. Will there be later changes?\nVersion 1.1 is the first minor revision of the OFL. We are confident that version 1.1 will meet most needs, but are open to future improvements. Any revisions would be for future font releases, and previously existing licenses would remain in effect. No retroactive changes are possible, although the Copyright Holder(s) can re-release the font under a revised OFL. All versions will be available on our web site: http:\/\/scripts.sil.org\/OFL.\n\n5.2  Can I use the SIL Open Font License for my own fonts?\nYes! We heartily encourage anyone to use the OFL to distribute their own original fonts. It is a carefully constructed license that allows great freedom along with enough artistic integrity protection for the work of the authors as well as clear rules for other contributors and those who redistribute the fonts. Some additional information about using the OFL is included at the end of this FAQ.\n\n5.3  Does this license restrict the rights of the Copyright Holder(s)?\nNo. The Copyright Holder(s) still retain(s) all the rights to their creation; they are only releasing a portion of it for use in a specific way. For example, the Copyright Holder(s) may choose to release a 'basic' version of their font under the OFL, but sell a restricted 'enhanced' version. Only the Copyright Holder(s) can do this.\n\n5.4 Is the OFL a contract or a license?\nThe OFL is a license and not a contract and so does not require you to sign it to have legal validity. By using, modifying and redistributing components under the OFL you indicate that you accept the license.\n\n5.5 How about translating the license and the FAQ into other languages?\nSIL certainly recognises the need for people who are not familiar with English to be able to understand the OFL and this FAQ better in their own language. Making the license very clear and readable is a key goal of the OFL.\n\nIf you are an experienced translator, you are very welcome to help by translating the OFL and its FAQ so that designers and users in your language community can understand the license better. But only the original English version of the license has legal value and has been approved by the community. Translations do not count as legal substitutes and should only serve as a way to explain the original license. SIL - as the author and steward of the license for the community at large - does not approve any translation of the OFL as legally valid because even small translation ambiguities could be abused and create problems.\n\nWe give permission to publish unofficial translations into other languages provided that they comply with the following guidelines:\n\n- put the following disclaimer in both English and the target language stating clearly that the translation is unofficial:\n\n\"This is an unofficial translation of the SIL Open Font License into $language. It was not published by SIL International, and does not legally state the distribution terms for fonts that use the OFL. A release under the OFL is only valid when using the original English text.\n\nHowever, we recognize that this unofficial translation will help users and designers not familiar with English to understand the SIL OFL better and make it easier to use and release font families under this collaborative font design model. We encourage designers who consider releasing their creation under the OFL to read the FAQ in their own language if it is available.\n \nPlease go to http:\/\/scripts.sil.org\/OFL for the official version of the license and the accompanying FAQ.\"\n\n- keep your unofficial translation current and update it at our request if needed, for example if there is any ambiguity which could lead to confusion.  \n\nIf you start such a unofficial translation effort of the OFL and its accompanying FAQ please let us know, thank you.\n\n\n6  ABOUT SIL INTERNATIONAL\n\n6.1  Who is SIL International and what does it do?\nSIL International is a worldwide faith-based education and development organization (NGO) that studies, documents, and assists in developing the world's lesser-known languages through literacy, linguistics, translation, and other academic disciplines. SIL makes its services available to all without regard to religious belief, political ideology, gender, race, or ethnic background. SIL's members and volunteers share a Christian commitment.\n\n6.2  What does this have to do with font licensing?\nThe ability to read, write, type and publish in one's own language is one of the most critical needs for millions of people around the world. This requires fonts that are widely available and support lesser-known languages. SIL develops - and encourages others to develop - a complete stack of writing systems implementation components available under open licenses. This open stack includes input methods, smart fonts, smart rendering libraries and smart applications. There has been a need for a common open license that is specifically applicable to fonts and related software (a crucial component of this stack) so SIL developed the SIL Open Font License with the help of the FLOSS community.\n\n6.3  How can I contact SIL?\nOur main web site is: http:\/\/www.sil.org\/\nOur site about complex scripts is: http:\/\/scripts.sil.org\/\nInformation about this license (including contact email information) is at: http:\/\/scripts.sil.org\/OFL","risk":3,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"e87978c3-36de-4e33-8f80-936c36047405"}
