Of\n     course this sample is even shorter than that, but it includes the\n     FDL anyway in order to show one conventional way to do so.  The\n     `fdl.texi' file is available on the GNU machines and in the\n     Texinfo and other GNU source distributions.\n\n     The FDL provides for omitting itself under certain conditions, but\n     in that case the sample texts given here have to be modified.\n     *Note GNU Free Documentation License::.\n\n   * If the FSF is not the copyright holder, then use the appropriate\n     name.\n\n   * If your manual is not published on paper by the FSF, then omit the\n     last sentence in the Back-Cover Text that talks about copies from\n     GNU Press.\n\n   * If your manual has Invariant Sections (again, see the license\n     itself for details), then change the text here accordingly.\n\n   * For documents that express your personal views, feelings or\n     experiences, it is more appropriate to use a license permitting\n     only verbatim copying, rather than the FDL.  *Note Verbatim\n     Copying License","risk":1,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"e0f68d0e-5219-4874-b36e-adf025f6c06d"}
