{"license":"","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"   A <q class=\"quote\">Secondary Section<\/q> is a named appendix or a front-matter\r\n   section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of\r\n   the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall\r\n   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\r\n   directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a\r\n   textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\r\n   mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection\r\n   with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\r\n   philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\r\n  <\/p>\r\n<p class=\"para\">\r\n   The <q class=\"quote\">Invariant Sections<\/q> are certain Secondary Sections\r\n   whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the\r\n   notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a\r\n   section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\r\n   allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero\r\n   Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant\r\n   Sections then there are none.\r\n  <\/p>\r\n<p class=\"para\">\r\n   The <q class=\"quote\">Cover Texts<\/q> are certain short passages of text that\r\n   are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that\r\n   says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text\r\n   may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\r\n  <\/p>\r\n<p class=\"para\">\r\n   A <q class=\"quote\">Transparent<\/q> copy of the Document means a\r\n   machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is\r\n   available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the\r\n   document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images\r\n   composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely\r\n   available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text\r\n   formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable\r\n   for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent\r\n   file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to\r\n   thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not\r\n   Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any\r\n   substantial amount of text. A copy that is not <q class=\"quote\">Transparent<\/q>\r\n   is called <q class=\"quote\">Opaque<\/q>.\r\n","risk":2,"trademark":0,"unique_id":"e4b74025-789b-40d3-a727-518860c9bd38"}
