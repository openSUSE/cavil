{"license":"GFDL-1.2","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n<\/PRE>\n\n\n<OL>\n<LI>\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document <EM>free<\/EM> in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n<LI>\n\nAPPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n\nA “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and\/or translated into another language.\n\nA “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section\nof the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in\npart a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n\nThe “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input\nformat, SGML or XML using a publicly available\nDTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,\nPostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples\nof transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and\nJPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be\nread and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or\nXML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are\nnot generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,\nPostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for\noutput purposes only.\n\nThe “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nA section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,\n“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n<LI>\n\nVERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n<LI>\n\nCOPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n<LI>\n\nMODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n\n<OL>\n<LI>\n\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\nfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\nof the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\nif the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n<LI>\n\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\nresponsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\nVersion, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\nDocument (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\nunless they release you from this requirement.\n\n<LI>\n\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\nModified Version, as the publisher.\n\n<LI>\n\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n<LI>\n\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\nadjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n<LI>\n\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\ngiving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\nterms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n<LI>\n\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\nand required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\n\n<LI>\n\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n<LI>\n\nPreserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add\nto it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\npublisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\nthere is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one\nstating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\ngiven on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\nVersion as stated in the previous sentence.\n\n<LI>\n\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\npublic access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\nthe network locations given in the Document for previous versions\nit was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section.\nYou may omit a network location for a work that was published at\nleast four years before the Document itself, or if the original\npublisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n\n<LI>\n\nFor any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve\nthe Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the\nsubstance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or\ndedications given therein.\n\n<LI>\n\nPreserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\nunaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\nor the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n\n<LI>\n\nDelete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section\nmay not be included in the Modified Version.\n\n<LI>\n\nDo not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or\nto conflict in title with any Invariant Section","risk":1,"spdx":"GFDL-1.2-only","trademark":0,"unique_id":"e6d25055-4e3a-4932-995c-051f6c022a90"}
