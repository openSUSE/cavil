Availability of Source Code.<\/h3>\n <p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in\n  Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable\n  version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,\n  must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became\n  available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular\n  Modification has been made available to such recipients.

Required Notices.<\/h3>\n <p>You must duplicate the notice in <a href=\"#exhibit-a\">Exhibit A<\/a> in each file of the\n  Source Code.

If You created one or more\n  Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n  <a href=\"#exhibit-a\">Exhibit A<\/a>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n  for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to\n  Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity\n  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so\n  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n  must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer\n  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\n  as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n <h3 id=\"section-3.6\">3.6.

The notice must be conspicuously included in any\n  notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of\n  Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n  different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this\n  License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n  recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If\n  You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely\n  clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the\n  Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n  a result of any such terms You offer.\n <h3 id=\"section-3.7\">3.7.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<\/h2>\n <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to\n  some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:\n  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe\n  the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the\n  <strong class=\"very-strong\">legal<\/strong> file described in Section\n  <a href=\"#section-3.4\">3.4<\/a> and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.\n  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n <h2 id=\"section-5\">5. Application of this License.<\/h2>\n <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in\n  <a href=\"#exhibit-a\">Exhibit A<\/a> and to related Covered Code.\n <h2 id=\"section-6\">6.

Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n <h3 id=\"section-6.2\">6.2. Effect of New Versions<\/h3>\n <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may\n  always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such\n  Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape.\n  No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code\n  created under this License.\n <h3 id=\"section-6.3\">6.3. Derivative Works<\/h3>\n <p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to\n apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)\n rename Your license so that the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\", \"MPL\",\n \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that\n your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of\n the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public\n License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the\n notice described in <a href=\"#exhibit-a\">Exhibit A<\/a> shall not of themselves be deemed to\n be modifications of this License.)\n <h2 id=\"section-7\">7. <strong class=\"very-strong\">Disclaimer of warranty<\/strong><\/h2>\n <p><strong class=\"very-strong\">Covered code is provided under this license on an \"as is\"\n  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without\n  limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a\n  particular purpose or non-infringing.

All sublicenses to the Covered Code which\n  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by\n  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n <p id=\"section-8.2\">8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n  claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor\n  (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to\n  as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n <ol type=\"a\">\n  <li id=\"section-8.2-a\">such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under\n   Sections <a href=\"#section-2.1\">2.1<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"#section-2.2\">2.2<\/a> of this\n   License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if\n   within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay\n   Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of\n   Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with\n   respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of\n   notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\n   writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by\n   Participant to You under Sections <a href=\"#section-2.1\">2.1<\/a> and\/or\n   <a href=\"#section-2.2\">2.2<\/a> automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day\n   notice period specified above.\n  <li id=\"section-8.2-b\">any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n   Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights\n   granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(<a href=\"#section-2.1-b\">b<\/a>)\n   and 2.2(<a href=\"#section-2.2-b\">b<\/a>) are revoked effective as of the date You first\n   made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n <\/ol>\n <p id=\"section-8.3\">8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n  alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes\n  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\n  initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n  granted by such Participant under Sections <a href=\"#section-2.1\">2.1<\/a> or\n  <a href=\"#section-2.2\">2.2<\/a> shall be taken into account in determining the amount or\n  value of any payment or license.\n <p id=\"section-8.4\">8.4. In the event of termination under Sections\n  <a href=\"#section-8.1\">8.1<\/a> or <a href=\"#section-8.2\">8.2<\/a> above, all end user\n  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly\n  granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n  termination.\n <h2 id=\"section-9\">9. <strong class=\"very-strong\">Limitation of liability<\/strong><\/h2>\n <p><strong class=\"very-strong\">Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether\n  tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer,\n  any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any of\n  such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or\n  consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss\n  of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\n  commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the\n  possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability\n  for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent\n  applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion\n  or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation\n  may not apply to you.<\/strong>\n <h2 id=\"section-10\">10. <abbr title=\"United States\">U.S.<\/abbr> government end users<\/h2>\n <p>The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48\n  <abbr>C.F.R.<\/abbr> 2.101 (<abbr title=\"October\">Oct.<\/abbr> 1995), consisting of\n  \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n  terms are used in 48 <abbr>C.F.R.<\/abbr> 12.212 (<abbr title=\"September\">Sept.<\/abbr>\n  1995).
