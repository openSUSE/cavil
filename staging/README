These are scripts to quickly set up and tear down a staging environment for development.

  $ perl staging/start.pl postgresql://tester:testing@/test
  ...
  $ CAVIL_CONF=staging/do_not_commit/cavil.conf morbo script/cavil
  ...
  $ CAVIL_CONF=staging/do_not_commit/cavil.conf script/cavil minion worker
  ...
  $ perl staging/stop.pl
  ...

You just need an already existing but empty PostgreSQL database, and we will create seed data for you. If you don't
want any example reports in your staging environment you can also append the `--clean` option to `staging/start.pl`.
